    "options": [
      "Behaviorist Theory",

      "Phonological Theory",
      "Memorization Theory"

    "options": [
      "Only social interaction matters",
      "Innate capacity alone determines success",
      "Acquisition results from innate predispositions, statistical learning, and social motivation",
      "Explicit instruction is always superior"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "feedback": "Correct! Modern SLA integrates biology (UG), cognition (pattern detection), and social-pragmatic factors—rejecting extreme nativist or empiricist views."

  {
    "question": "Why is the Behaviorist Theory considered inadequate for explaining language acquisition?",
    "options": [
      "It overemphasizes the role of social interaction",

    "question": "How does Krashen’s acquisition-learning distinction impact teaching?",
    "options": [
      "It favors grammar drills over communication",
      "It suggests meaningful input and interaction are more important than explicit rule teaching for fluency",
      "It eliminates the need for teachers",
      "It requires memorizing dictionaries"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "feedback": "Correct! Since acquisition drives proficiency, teaching should prioritize engaging, comprehensible input in authentic communicative contexts."

      "Memorizing sentence frames",
      "Correcting every error immediately"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "feedback": "Correct! Scaffolding (Bruner) involves responsive adjustments—like expanding a child’s utterance ('Ball!' → 'Yes, a red ball!')—to support development."

    "question": "Which stage marks the beginning of rapid vocabulary expansion and emergent syntax?",
    "options": [

        const trueFalseQuestions = 
        [
  {
    "question": "Language acquisition is a conscious process that relies on explicit grammar instruction.",
    "options": ["True", "False"],
    "correct": 1,
    "feedback": "False! Acquisition is **natural, unconscious internalization** through meaningful interaction and exposure—not explicit teaching. Conscious rule-learning is 'learning,' not acquisition (Krashen, 1985)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Children acquiring their first language is a classic example of natural language acquisition.",
    "options": ["True", "False"],
    "correct": 0,
    "feedback": "True! L1 development occurs without formal instruction—through immersion, interaction, and communicative need—making it the quintessential case of acquisition."
  },
  {
    "question": "Krashen (1985) argued that linguistic development occurs primarily through explicit instruction rather than meaningful interaction.",
    "options": ["True", "False"],
    "correct": 1,

    "options": ["True", "False"],
    "correct": 0,
    "feedback": "True! Chomsky (1965) argued that children’s rapid, uniform grammar development despite limited input implies an innate biological foundation for language."
  },
  {
    "question": "Social-Interactionist theories (e.g., Vygotsky, Bruner) emphasize that communicative context and social interaction drive language development.",
    "options": ["True", "False"],
    "correct": 0,
    "feedback": "True! These theories highlight scaffolding, joint attention, and functional communication as central to acquisition—language emerges from social need."
  },
  {
    "question": "During the Two-Word Stage (18–24 months), children produce full grammatical sentences with articles and verb conjugations.",
    "options": ["True", "False"],

  },
  {
    "question": "Overgeneralization (e.g., saying 'goed' instead of 'went') occurs during the Multi-Word Stage and reflects active, rule-governed learning.",
    "options": ["True", "False"],
    "correct": 0,
    "feedback": "True! Overgeneralization shows children are not just imitating—they’re **hypothesizing and applying rules** (e.g., -ed for past tense), proving creative language use."
  },
  {
    "question": "Pragmatic competence—the ability to use language appropriately in context—is not part of language acquisition.",
    "options": ["True", "False"],
    "correct": 1,
    "feedback": "False! Pragmatic competence is a **key component** of acquisition, developing alongside phonology, grammar, and semantics through social interaction."
  },
  {
    "question": "The current research consensus holds that language acquisition results from a combination of innate predispositions, statistical learning, and social motivation.",
    "options": ["True", "False"],
    "correct": 0,
    "feedback": "True! Modern views integrate nature and nurture—biology provides a foundation, but input, interaction, and cognitive processing shape development."
  },
  {
    "question": "In the One-Word Stage (12–18 months), comprehension typically exceeds production.",
    "options": ["True", "False"],
    "correct": 0,
    "feedback": "True! Children understand many words but produce only ~50—showing that receptive language develops faster than expressive language."

    "options": ["True", "False"],
    "correct": 0,
    "feedback": "True! Learning to read and write helps children reflect on language structure—enhancing grammar, vocabulary, and academic language skills."

  {
    "question": "The Interactionist Theory rejects the role of innate capacities and focuses solely on environmental input.",
    "options": ["True", "False"],
    "correct": 1,
    "feedback": "False! Interactionist theories **integrate** biological readiness with social experience—they don’t deny innateness but emphasize how interaction activates it."

    "options": ["True", "False"],
    "correct": 1,

    "question": "Semantic networks in acquisition refer to how learners build interconnected webs of word meanings and concepts.",
    "options": ["True", "False"],
    "correct": 0,

    "options": ["True", "False"],
    "correct": 1,

    "options": ["True", "False"],
    "correct": 1,
