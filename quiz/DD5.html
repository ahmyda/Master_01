      "Pedagogic and natural",
      "Teacher-centered and student-centered"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "feedback": "Kramsch (1998) frames classroom discourse along a continuum from pedagogic (structured, teacher-led, accuracy-focused) to natural (spontaneous, collaborative, fluency-oriented)."
  },
  {
    "question": "According to Walsh (2011), what does Classroom Interactional Competence (CIC) refer to?",
    "options": [
      "A teacher’s ability to correct grammar errors instantly",
      "The capacity to use classroom interaction as a tool for mediating and assisting learning",
      "Students’ fluency in speaking without hesitation",
      "The use of technology to manage classroom communication"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "feedback": "Walsh (2011) defines CIC as 'the ability to use interaction as a tool for mediating and assisting learning,' encompassing questioning, turn-taking, feedback, and clarification strategies."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which of the following best describes 'Learner Talk Time' (LTT)?",
    "options": [
      "Time when students are silent and listening to the teacher",
      "The total minutes students spend chatting off-task",
      "Opportunities for learners to use the target language meaningfully through interaction",
      "Time allocated for reading textbooks independently"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "feedback": "LTT refers to purposeful, communicative language use by learners—essential for developing fluency, negotiating meaning, and practicing the target language in context."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the primary purpose of a referential question in classroom discourse?",
    "options": [
      "To test students’ memory of vocabulary",
      "To check grammatical accuracy during drills",
      "To elicit information the teacher does not already know",
      "To maintain strict classroom control"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "feedback": "Referential questions (e.g., 'What was your favorite part of the story?') create genuine information gaps and promote authentic communication, unlike display questions where the answer is known."
  },
  {
    "question": "In pedagogic discourse, who typically controls the topic and flow of conversation?",
    "options": [
      "The learners",
      "The textbook",
      "The teacher",
      "Random chance"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "feedback": "Pedagogic discourse is teacher-led, with clear role distinctions: the teacher initiates topics, asks known-answer questions, and evaluates responses (e.g., IRF pattern)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which interactional strategy involves adjusting speech to make it more understandable for learners?",
    "options": [
      "Code-switching",
      "Speech modification",
      "Silent period enforcement",
      "L1 translation"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "feedback": "Speech modification—such as slowing rate, simplifying syntax, or repeating key phrases—enhances comprehensibility without oversimplifying, supporting input processing (Ellis, 2008)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the IRF pattern stand for in classroom discourse analysis?",
    "options": [
      "Instruction, Response, Feedback",
      "Initiation, Reaction, Follow-up",
      "Initiation, Response, Feedback",
      "Interaction, Reflection, Formation"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "feedback": "IRF (Initiation-Response-Feedback) is a common tripartite structure in pedagogic discourse, first described by Sinclair & Coulthard (1975), where the teacher initiates a question, a student responds, and the teacher gives evaluative feedback."
  },
  {
    "question": "According to Swain’s Output Hypothesis, why is learner talk important?",
    "options": [
      "It helps learners memorize vocabulary faster",
      "It allows learners to practice pronunciation in isolation",
      "It pushes learners to process language syntactically and notice gaps in their knowledge",
      "It reduces the teacher’s workload"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "feedback": "Swain (1995) argues that producing language (output) forces learners beyond comprehension, helping them test hypotheses and refine their interlanguage through use."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which of the following is a key feature of natural discourse in the classroom?",
    "options": [
      "Learners only answer closed questions",
      "The teacher provides all the correct answers",
      "Learners initiate topics and express genuine opinions",
      "Grammar is corrected immediately after every error"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "feedback": "In natural discourse, roles are fluid, topics emerge from learners, and communication focuses on meaning—mirroring real-world conversation (Kramsch, 1998)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the main goal of effective teacher talk?",
    "options": [
      "To demonstrate linguistic proficiency",
      "To fill silence and maintain authority",
      "To scaffold learning and create space for meaningful learner interaction",
      "To minimize student questions"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "feedback": "Effective teacher talk is purposeful: it explains, models, organizes tasks, and—crucially—creates opportunities for learners to communicate (Walsh, 2011)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which type of question is this: 'What did you think about the main character’s decision?'",
    "options": [
      "Display question",
      "Referential question",
      "Closed question",
      "Rhetorical question"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "feedback": "This is a referential question because the teacher does not know the learner’s personal opinion and is seeking new information—promoting authentic expression."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is equitable turn-taking important in classroom discourse?",
    "options": [
      "It ensures only the best students participate",
      "It reduces the need for group work",
      "It gives all learners opportunities to practice and co-construct meaning",
      "It speeds up lesson delivery"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "feedback": "Fair turn distribution is part of CIC (Walsh, 2011). It prevents dominance by a few and ensures inclusive, participatory learning."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which theorist emphasized that negotiation of meaning (e.g., clarification requests) supports L2 acquisition?",
    "options": [
      "Vygotsky",
      "Krashen",
      "Michael Long",
      "Gardner"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "feedback": "Long’s (1996) Interaction Hypothesis posits that negotiating meaning during conversation makes input more comprehensible and draws attention to linguistic form."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a key limitation of overusing the IRF pattern?",
    "options": [
      "It increases grammar accuracy too quickly",
      "It encourages too much learner autonomy",
      "It limits extended discourse and reinforces teacher-centered interaction",
      "It reduces classroom noise levels"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "feedback": "IRF tends to produce short, evaluative exchanges that stifle dialogue and learner agency, contrasting with open-ended, collaborative discourse."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which of the following best illustrates a blend of pedagogic and natural discourse?",
    "options": [
      "The teacher lectures for 45 minutes without student input",
      "Students take a silent grammar quiz",
      "The teacher explains a grammar rule, then students role-play a real-life situation using it",
      "Learners watch a video with no follow-up discussion"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "feedback": "This sequence uses pedagogic discourse for instruction and natural discourse for meaningful application—aligning with Kramsch’s (1998) balanced approach."
  },
  {
    "question": "What role does feedback play in developing interactional competence?",
    "options": [
      "It should only correct errors to ensure accuracy",
      "It should always be delayed until the end of class",
      "It can draw attention to form while maintaining communication flow (e.g., through recasts)",
      "It is unnecessary in fluency-focused tasks"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "feedback": "Effective feedback (e.g., recasts, elicitation) supports learning without disrupting communication—balancing fluency and accuracy (Lyster & Ranta, 1997; Walsh, 2011)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which term refers to learners’ ability to manage conversations through requests for clarification or repetition?",
    "options": [
      "Metacognitive strategies",
      "Affective strategies",
      "Social strategies",
      "Interactional strategies"
    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "feedback": "Interactional strategies—like saying 'Could you repeat that?'—help learners maintain communication and are part of developing CIC (Walsh, 2011)."
  },
  {
    "question": "In a language classroom, why is LTT particularly important?",
    "options": [
      "It gives the teacher time to prepare the next activity",
      "It ensures students stay quiet and focused",
      "Because the target language is both the subject and medium of instruction",
      "Because exams only test speaking skills"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "feedback": "Since learners must *use* English to learn English, LTT provides essential practice for developing productive and interactional skills in authentic contexts."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which strategy helps a teacher increase meaningful LTT during a discussion task?",
    "options": [
      "Answering all questions immediately",
      "Providing a clear information gap and assigning roles (e.g., interviewer/interviewee)",
      "Allowing only volunteers to speak",
      "Correcting every grammatical error on the spot"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "feedback": "Structured tasks with genuine purposes (e.g., information gaps) create conditions for extended, purposeful LTT—central to communicative language teaching."
  },
  {
    "question": "According to Walsh (2011), how can teachers develop their own CIC?",
    "options": [
      "By memorizing grammar rules",
      "By avoiding all student errors",
      "Through reflective practice, such as analyzing recorded lessons for interactional patterns",
      "By speaking less and assigning more worksheets"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "feedback": "Walsh (2011) advocates reflective analysis of classroom discourse (e.g., TTT/LTT ratio, question types) as a key method for developing CIC and improving practice."

        const trueFalseQuestions = 

        [
  {
    "question": "Teacher Talk Time (TTT) should always be minimized to increase student participation.",
    "options": ["True", "False"],
    "correct": 1,
    "feedback": "The lecture emphasizes that TTT should be *strategic*, not simply reduced. High-quality TTT (e.g., modeling, scaffolding) supports learning, while the goal is to maximize *meaningful* Learner Talk Time (LTT), not eliminate TTT entirely."
  },
  {
    "question": "According to Walsh (2011), effective teacher talk focuses more on quantity than on purpose and clarity.",
    "options": ["True", "False"],
    "correct": 1,
    "feedback": "Walsh (2011) argues that the *quality, variety, and purpose* of teacher talk matter far more than how much the teacher speaks. Speaking to fill silence does not support learning."
  },
  {
    "question": "Learner Talk Time (LTT) is essential in a language classroom because English serves as both the subject and the medium of instruction.",
    "options": ["True", "False"],
    "correct": 0,
    "feedback": "This is true. Since the target language is used for both content and communication, LTT provides crucial opportunities for practice, fluency development, and meaningful use."
  },
  {
    "question": "Classroom Interactional Competence (CIC) refers only to the teacher’s ability to manage discipline and maintain order.",
    "options": ["True", "False"],
    "correct": 1,
    "feedback": "CIC, as defined by Walsh (2011), is 'the ability to use interaction as a tool for mediating and assisting learning.' It includes questioning, turn-taking, feedback, and clarification—not classroom management alone."
  },
  {
    "question": "Referential questions are those where the teacher already knows the answer.",
    "options": ["True", "False"],
    "correct": 1,
    "feedback": "False. Referential questions seek *new* information (e.g., 'What did you do last weekend?'). Display questions are those where the teacher knows the answer (e.g., 'What’s the past tense of go?')."
  },
  {
    "question": "Display questions are more effective than referential questions for promoting authentic communication.",
    "options": ["True", "False"],
    "correct": 1,
    "feedback": "False. Referential questions simulate real conversation by creating genuine information gaps, making them more effective for fluency and communicative competence. Display questions are useful for accuracy checks but less engaging."
  },
  {
    "question": "Kramsch (1998) describes classroom discourse as existing on a continuum from pedagogic to natural discourse.",
    "options": ["True", "False"],
    "correct": 0,
    "feedback": "True. Pedagogic discourse is teacher-led and accuracy-focused; natural discourse is collaborative and fluency-oriented. Effective teaching blends both."
  },
  {
    "question": "In natural discourse, the teacher is always the sole authority and source of knowledge.",
    "options": ["True", "False"],
    "correct": 1,
    "feedback": "False. In natural discourse, roles are flexible and knowledge is co-constructed by teachers and learners through collaboration and negotiation of meaning."
  },
  {
    "question": "Pedagogic discourse typically involves learners initiating topics and expressing personal opinions freely.",
    "options": ["True", "False"],
    "correct": 1,
    "feedback": "False. This describes *natural* discourse. Pedagogic discourse is structured, teacher-initiated, and often involves known-answer questions with limited learner autonomy."
  },
  {
    "question": "The IRF (Initiation-Response-Feedback) pattern is a common feature of pedagogic classroom discourse.",
    "options": ["True", "False"],
    "correct": 0,
    "feedback": "True. IRF, identified by Sinclair & Coulthard (1975), is a tripartite structure where the teacher initiates, a student responds, and the teacher evaluates—common in traditional, teacher-centered classrooms."
  },
  {
    "question": "Speech modification by teachers (e.g., slowing speech, simplifying syntax) is always considered ‘foreigner talk’ and should be avoided.",
    "options": ["True", "False"],
    "correct": 1,
    "feedback": "False. Purposeful speech modification (‘teacher talk’) enhances comprehensibility and supports input processing. It differs from ‘foreigner talk,’ which can be patronizing or inaccurate."
  },
  {
    "question": "According to Swain’s Output Hypothesis, producing language helps learners notice gaps in their knowledge and develop accuracy.",
    "options": ["True", "False"],
    "correct": 0,
    "feedback": "True. Swain (1995) argues that output pushes learners to move beyond comprehension to syntactic processing, aiding interlanguage development."
  },
  {
    "question": "Long’s Interaction Hypothesis suggests that negotiation of meaning (e.g., clarification requests) facilitates second language acquisition.",
    "options": ["True", "False"],
    "correct": 0,
    "feedback": "True. Long (1996) posits that interaction involving meaning negotiation makes input more comprehensible and draws attention to form, supporting acquisition."
  },
  {
    "question": "Classroom discourse includes only verbal exchanges and excludes nonverbal communication.",
    "options": ["True", "False"],
    "correct": 1,
    "feedback": "False. While often analyzed through spoken language, classroom discourse broadly encompasses verbal and nonverbal interaction, including gestures, eye contact, and proximity."
  },
  {
    "question": "Effective teachers use only natural discourse to create a relaxed and student-centered environment.",
    "options": ["True", "False"],
    "correct": 1,
    "feedback": "False. The ideal classroom *balances* both types: pedagogic discourse for structured input and natural discourse for authentic practice (Kramsch, 1998)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Turn-taking in the classroom is automatic and does not require teacher facilitation.",
    "options": ["True", "False"],
    "correct": 1,
    "feedback": "False. Teachers with high CIC actively manage turn-taking to ensure equitable participation, using strategies like wait time, pair work, or structured discussion protocols."
  },
  {
    "question": "Clarification requests (e.g., 'What do you mean by...?') are interactional features that support meaning negotiation and learning.",
    "options": ["True", "False"],
    "correct": 0,
    "feedback": "True. These are key components of learner interactional competence and help resolve misunderstandings during communication."
  },
  {
    "question": "A teacher who asks, 'Is this sentence correct?' is using a referential question.",
    "options": ["True", "False"],
    "correct": 1,
    "feedback": "False. This is a *display* question—the teacher likely knows the answer and is checking accuracy. A referential version would be, 'How would you say this more naturally?'"
  },
  {
    "question": "Learner talk is only valuable when it is grammatically accurate.",
    "options": ["True", "False"],
    "correct": 1,
    "feedback": "False. Fluency, risk-taking, and communicative success are often prioritized in meaningful LTT. Accuracy develops over time through interaction, feedback, and noticing."
  },
  {
    "question": "Walsh (2011) argues that both teachers and learners can develop Classroom Interactional Competence (CIC) through awareness and practice.",
    "options": ["True", "False"],
    "correct": 0,
    "feedback": "True. CIC is not just a teacher skill—it includes learners’ ability to participate effectively in classroom interaction (e.g., asking for help, managing turns)."
