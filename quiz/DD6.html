    "options": [
      "Waiting for problems to occur before acting",
      "Relying solely on rewards and punishments",

  },
  {
    "question": "Why is 'good teaching' not always enough for effective classroom management?",
    "options": [

      "Because all students learn at the same pace"
    ],
    "correct": 1,

    "options": ["True", "False"],
    "correct": 0,
    "feedback": "True. Doyle (1985) defines classroom management as involving 'the structures and processes that make both teaching and learning possible,' highlighting its foundational role."
  },
  {
    "question": "A well-organized physical classroom environment has little impact on student behavior or engagement.",
    "options": ["True", "False"],
    "correct": 1,
    "feedback": "False. The lecture states that the physical environment (e.g., layout, lighting, arrangement) significantly affects focus, comfort, and behavior—supporting or hindering learning."
  },
  {
    "question": "Routines and procedures help students feel secure and reduce off-task behavior by providing predictability.",
    "options": ["True", "False"],
    "correct": 0,
    "feedback": "True. Clear, consistent routines (e.g., warm-ups, transitions) create stability, lower anxiety, and free mental resources for learning."
  },
  {
    "question": "Restorative discipline focuses on punishment to deter future misbehavior.",
    "options": ["True", "False"],
    "correct": 1,
    "feedback": "False. Restorative practices emphasize reflection, accountability, and repairing harm—teaching responsibility rather than imposing penalties."

  {
    "question": "Differentiating instruction based on VARK learning preferences is a classroom management strategy.",
    "options": ["True", "False"],
    "correct": 0,
    "feedback": "True. Tailoring lessons to visual, auditory, reading/writing, and kinesthetic preferences increases engagement and reduces boredom—a common cause of misbehavior."
  },
  {
    "question": "Good lesson planning alone is sufficient to ensure effective classroom management.",
    "options": ["True", "False"],
    "correct": 1,

  },
  {
    "question": "Classroom management is only necessary in large or 'difficult' classes.",
    "options": ["True", "False"],
    "correct": 1,
    "feedback": "False. Effective CM is essential in all learning environments—it shapes culture, engagement, and safety, regardless of class size or student profile."

  {
    "question": "A teacher who uses restorative conversations after a conflict is practicing punitive discipline.",
    "options": ["True", "False"],
    "correct": 1,
    "feedback": "False. Restorative conversations are non-punitive; they focus on understanding impact, taking responsibility, and healing relationships."
  },

  },
  {
    "question": "Teacher-student relationships have little influence on student cooperation and behavior.",
    "options": ["True", "False"],
    "correct": 1,
    "feedback": "False. Strong, trusting relationships significantly increase student willingness to follow norms and participate positively."
  },
  {
    "question": "Classroom procedures should be taught once at the beginning of the year and never revisited.",
    "options": ["True", "False"],
    "correct": 1,
    "feedback": "False. Routines may need reteaching, modeling, or adjusting throughout the year based on student needs and classroom dynamics."

  {
    "question": "Managing learning effectively includes designing tasks that match diverse student needs and interests.",
    "options": ["True", "False"],
    "correct": 0,
    "feedback": "True. The 'management of learning' component involves creating engaging, differentiated activities that sustain attention and reduce disruptions."

  {
    "question": "Discipline in modern classroom management should aim to teach, not just to punish.",
    "options": ["True", "False"],
    "correct": 0,

  },
  {
    "question": "A silent classroom always indicates effective classroom management.",
    "options": ["True", "False"],
    "correct": 1,
    "feedback": "False. Productive classrooms often include discussion, collaboration, and movement. Silence may signal disengagement or fear—not effective management."
  },
  {
    "question": "According to Brophy (1986), classroom management helps maintain conditions that maximize student learning and engagement.",
    "options": ["True", "False"],
    "correct": 0,
    "feedback": "True. Brophy (1986) defines effective CM as creating optimal conditions for both learning and active student involvement."

    "question": "Allowing students to co-create classroom norms can support a sense of ownership and responsibility.",
    "options": ["True", "False"],
    "correct": 0,

  },
  {
    "question": "The physical arrangement of desks has no educational significance in classroom management.",
