        const mcqQuestions = 
        [
  {
    "question": "According to Armstrong and Firth (1984), what is self-monitoring?",
    "options": [
      "A method of student assessment",
      "A way to replace external evaluations",
      "A systematic approach to observing, evaluating, and managing one’s own behavior",
      "A technique for disciplining students"

      "Blind Self",
      "Hidden Self"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "feedback": " The Secret Self contains internal thoughts and intentions—like wanting to build confidence in shy students—that aren’t visible to others."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is regular self-monitoring important?",
    "options": [
      "Because it replaces collaboration with peers",
      "Because one-time reflection is enough for lifelong teaching",

      "By avoiding difficult questions"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "feedback": " Self-monitoring turns reflection into an evidence-based practice—moving beyond 'Did I like the lesson?' to 'What worked, why, and how can it improve?'"
  },
  {
    "question": "What role does a teaching log play in self-monitoring?",
    "options": [
      "It records only student misbehavior",

    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "feedback": " Video provides an unfiltered record of teaching—allowing teachers to notice patterns in pacing, questioning, movement, and student responses they might otherwise miss."
  },
  {
    "question": "How might self-monitoring differ for novice vs. experienced teachers?",
    "options": [
      "Novices focus on survival; experienced teachers explore innovation and nuance",
      "Only novices need to reflect",
      "Experienced teachers don’t have blind spots",
      "Self-monitoring is irrelevant to both"
    ],
    "correct": 0,
