        [
  {
    "question": "Why does language differ among speakers?",
    "options": [
      "Because some people are naturally better at grammar",
      "Because language is fixed and unchanging",
      "Because of region, social group, education, and context",
      "Because only written language varies"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "feedback": " Language varies based on who you are, where you’re from, your background, and the situation—e.g., saying 'Give me the salt' at home vs. 'Could you please pass me the salt?' in class."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is an idiolect?",
    "options": [
      "A regional accent shared by a city",
      "The official language of a country",
      "Your personal, unique way of speaking",
      "A type of formal register"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "feedback": " An idiolect is your speech 'fingerprint'—including your speed, word choices, tone, and expressions like always saying 'bro' or 'wallah.'"
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is 'variety' considered a neutral term in sociolinguistics?",
    "options": [
      "Because it only refers to pronunciation",
      "Because it avoids political judgments about which form is 'correct'",
      "Because it applies only to dead languages",
      "Because it’s easier to spell"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "feedback": " 'Variety' is a descriptive, non-evaluative term for any systematic language form—whether regional, social, or professional—without labeling it 'good' or 'bad.'"

    "options": [
      "Grammar rules",
      "Vocabulary choice",

      "Pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammar",
      "Only formal language",
      "Only written forms"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "feedback": " A dialect is a full language system. In Algerian Arabic, Oran ('wesh rak?'), Constantine ('chna7walek?'), and Djelfa ('kifach rak?') show dialectal differences in all three components."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the saying 'A language is a dialect with an army and a navy' imply?",
    "options": [
      "Navies speak the best grammar",
      "All dialects are the same",
      "Political power decides which dialect becomes the 'standard' language",
      "Languages require military training"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "feedback": " The quote highlights that linguistic prestige is tied to political and institutional power—not linguistic complexity or logic."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is 'register'?",
    "options": [
      "A type of regional dialect",
      "Your personal speech habits",
      "How language changes based on situation, audience, and purpose",
      "A list of vocabulary words"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "feedback": " Register shifts with context: 'Good morning, ladies and gentlemen' (formal) vs. 'Hey guys!' (casual)—same meaning, different social setting."

      "Accent",
      "Professional variety (jargon)",
      "Idiolect"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "feedback": " This is professional jargon—a subtype of variety used within a specific field (medicine) to communicate precisely."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which example shows register variation?",
    "options": [
      "An Algerian from Oran saying 'wesh rak?'",
      "A British person pronouncing 'bath' with /ɑː/",
      "Saying 'I would like to ask a question' to a professor vs. 'Bro, wait...' to a friend",
      "Always using the word 'seriously?' in conversation"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "feedback": " This is a classic register shift—adjusting formality based on audience and context, not region or personal habit."
  },
  {
    "question": "What changes in an idiolect?",
    "options": [
      "Region and nationality",
      "Pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammar of a group",
      "Individual speech habits like word choice and tone",
      "Official language policy"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "feedback": " Idiolect captures your unique linguistic fingerprint—e.g., one friend says 'bro,' another 'wallah,' another 'seriously?'—all personal, repeated patterns."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which term best describes the language of gamers who use 'buff,' 'nerf,' and 'lag'?",

      "Accent",
      "Register",
      "Professional/interest-based variety",
      "Standard dialect"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "feedback": " This is a specialized variety tied to a community of practice (gaming), not a regional dialect or situational register."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does Algerian Arabic illustrate dialect variation?",
    "options": [
      "All cities use the same words and grammar",
      "Only pronunciation differs, not meaning",
      "Cities like Oran, Constantine, and Djelfa use different words for the same meaning",
      "It has no variation because it’s not a 'real' language"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "feedback": " 'Wesh rak?' (Oran), 'chna7walek?' (Constantine), and 'kifach rak?' (Djelfa) all mean the same thing but reflect regional dialect differences in vocabulary and structure."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which statement about language variation is true?",
    "options": [
      "Variation is random and meaningless",
      "Variation only occurs in written language",
      "Variation happens unconsciously and reflects social identity",
      "Only uneducated people use non-standard forms"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "feedback": " Sociolinguistics shows that variation is systematic, meaningful, and often automatic—it reveals who we are and how we relate to others."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the key difference between accent and dialect?",
    "options": [
      "Accent includes grammar; dialect does not",
      "Dialect includes accent, vocabulary, and grammar; accent is pronunciation only",
      "They mean the same thing",
      "Dialect is formal; accent is informal"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "feedback": " Accent = pronunciation only. Dialect = pronunciation + vocabulary + grammar (e.g., Algerian regional forms)."

      "Religious register",
      "Regional dialect"

      "Accent loss",
      "Dialect extinction"

      "Pronunciation",
      "Vocabulary",
      "Grammar",
      "Hand gestures"
    ],
    "correct": 3,

  },
  {
    "question": "What does using 'The data indicates a significant correlation' instead of 'It looks like it worked' show?",
    "options": [
      "Accent change",
      "Idiolect development",
      "Scientific register",
      "Regional dialect"
    ],

  },
  {
    "question": "Why do sociolinguists prefer the term 'variety' over 'slang' or 'broken language'?",
    "options": [
      "Because 'variety' sounds fancier",
      "Because it’s objective and non-judgmental",
      "Because it’s shorter",
      "Because it’s required by law"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
