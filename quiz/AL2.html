  {
    "question": "What is the central assumption of Contrastive Analysis (CA)?",
    "options": [
      "L2 errors are mainly caused by poor motivation or lack of practice.",
      "L2 acquisition is independent of the learner’s first language.",
      "The primary source of L2 errors is L1 interference, with greater differences causing more difficulty.",
      "All learners make the same errors regardless of their native language."
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "feedback": " As Lee (1968) stated, CA assumes that L1 interference is the main cause of L2 errors—greater structural differences between L1 and L2 lead to more learning difficulty, while similarities ease acquisition."
  },
  {
    "question": "According to Lado (1957), how can teachers anticipate learner difficulties?",
    "options": [
      "By ignoring students’ native languages completely.",
      "By comparing the learner’s native language and culture with the target language and culture.",
      "By focusing only on the target language’s literary texts.",
      "By assuming all grammatical rules are universally transferable."
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "feedback": " Lado argued that systematic comparison between L1 and L2 (and their cultures) allows teachers to predict which structures will be difficult due to differences and which will be easy due to similarities."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which of the following is an example of negative transfer from Arabic to English?",
    "options": [
      "Using 'I saw' correctly for past events.",
      "Saying 'He is doctor' instead of 'He is a doctor'.",
      "Pronouncing /t/ and /d/ accurately.",
      "Using question intonation appropriately."
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "feedback": " Arabic lacks indefinite articles like 'a/an,' so Arab learners often omit them—this is a classic case of negative transfer explained by Contrastive Analysis."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does 'positive transfer' refer to in Contrastive Analysis?",
    "options": [
      "The learner develops a positive attitude toward the target culture.",
      "The teacher uses only positive reinforcement in class.",
      "Similarities between L1 and L2 structures facilitate learning.",
      "The learner avoids using their L1 in any context."
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "feedback": " Positive transfer occurs when L1 and L2 share similar features (e.g., both having a Simple Past tense), which makes acquisition easier for the learner."
  },
  {
    "question": "According to Stockwell et al. (1965), which contrast type is the MOST difficult for learners?",
    "options": [
      "Complete Correspondence",
      "Coalesced Forms",
      "New Category",
      "Split"
    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "feedback": " A 'Split'—where L1 has one form but L2 requires two or more distinct forms (e.g., English 'the' vs. no article in some L1s)—is ranked as the most difficult in Stockwell’s hierarchy."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why did Contrastive Analysis lose favor in the 1970s?",
    "options": [
      "It was too expensive to implement in classrooms.",
      "It perfectly predicted all learner errors with 100% accuracy.",
      "It overpredicted errors and failed to account for developmental errors like 'goed' or 'hurted'.",
      "It focused too much on communicative competence."
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "feedback": " CA was criticized for overpredicting (foreseeing problems that never occurred) and underpredicting (missing errors caused by L2 rule overgeneralization, like *goed*), which stem from internal cognitive processes—not L1 interference."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which error by an Arabic-speaking English learner CANNOT be explained by Contrastive Analysis?",
    "options": [
      "Saying 'She go to school' instead of 'She goes to school'.",
      "Using 'Did you finish your homework yet?' instead of 'Have you finished...?'",
      "Saying 'He comed yesterday' instead of 'He came yesterday'.",
      "Omitting 'a' in 'She is teacher.'"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "feedback": " 'Comed' results from overgeneralizing the English past-tense -ed rule—a developmental error internal to L2 acquisition, not caused by Arabic. CA cannot explain such errors."
  },
  {
    "question": "In which teaching context is Contrastive Analysis most useful today?",
    "options": [
      "In large, multilingual online courses with random L1 backgrounds.",
      "In homogeneous classes where all students share the same L1 (e.g., Arabic speakers).",
      "Only in theoretical linguistics research labs.",
      "When using the direct method that bans L1 use entirely."
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "feedback": " CA is especially practical in homogeneous classrooms, where teachers can anticipate common L1-based errors (e.g., article omission by Arab learners) and design targeted instruction."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the correct order of difficulty in Stockwell et al.’s (1965) hierarchy, from MOST to LEAST difficult?",

      "Split, New Category, Absent Category, Coalesced Forms, Complete Correspondence",
      "New Category, Split, Coalesced, Absent Category, Complete Correspondence",
      "Complete Correspondence, Coalesced, Absent, New, Split",
      "Absent Category, Split, New, Coalesced, Complete Correspondence"
    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "feedback": " The hierarchy is: (1) Split, (2) New Category, (3) Absent Category, (4) Coalesced Forms, (5) Complete Correspondence—reflecting decreasing levels of expected difficulty."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which step is part of the traditional Contrastive Analysis methodology?",
    "options": [
      "Collecting learner errors before comparing languages.",
      "Using different grammatical frameworks for L1 and L2.",
      "Developing teaching materials based on predicted L1-L2 difficulties.",
      "Avoiding any mention of the learner’s native language."
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "feedback": " One of the five traditional CA steps is to develop teaching materials after identifying structural similarities and differences using the same descriptive model for both languages."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does enhanced Contrastive Analysis differ from the traditional version?",
    "options": [
      "It rejects all comparison between languages.",
      "It assumes L1 has no influence on L2 learning.",
      "It tests predictions against actual learner data before designing instruction.",
      "It relies solely on native speaker intuition."
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "feedback": " Enhanced CA adds empirical validation: hypotheses from L1-L2 comparison are tested with real learner data, making the approach more scientific and less speculative."
  },
  {
    "question": "Contrastive Analysis is primarily based on which learning theory?",
    "options": [
      "Constructivism",
      "Cognitive Theory",
      "Behaviorism",
      "Sociocultural Theory"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "feedback": " CA assumes language learning is habit formation—where L1 habits either facilitate (positive transfer) or interfere (negative transfer) with new L2 habits—aligning with behaviorist views dominant in the 1950s–60s."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does 'Coalesced Forms' mean in Stockwell’s hierarchy?",
    "options": [
      "L2 has multiple forms where L1 has one.",
      "L1 has multiple forms but L2 uses a single form for all.",
      "Both languages use entirely different systems with no overlap.",
      "The grammatical category exists only in L2."
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "feedback": " 'Coalesced Forms' occur when L1 distinguishes several categories (e.g., verb aspects), but L2 collapses them into one form—making it moderately difficult but less so than a 'Split.'"
  },
  {
    "question": "Which scholar is most associated with establishing CA as a predictive framework in language teaching?",
    "options": [
      "Noam Chomsky",
      "Stephen Krashen",
      "Robert Lado",
      "Dell Hymes"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "feedback": " Robert Lado’s 1957 book 'Linguistics Across Cultures' laid the foundation for CA as a method to predict learning difficulties through systematic L1-L2 comparison."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is an 'Absent Category' in Contrastive Analysis?",
    "options": [
      "A structure present in L2 but missing in L1.",
      "A structure present in L1 but missing in L2.",
      "A phoneme that is silent in both languages.",
      "A vocabulary item that has no translation."
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "feedback": " An 'Absent Category' refers to a feature that exists in the learner’s L1 but not in the L2—ranked third in difficulty in Stockwell’s hierarchy."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which of the following best illustrates the practical use of CA in teaching English to Arab learners?",
    "options": [
      "Assuming they will naturally acquire English articles without instruction.",
      "Ignoring all grammar and focusing only on conversation.",
      "Designing lessons that explicitly contrast Arabic and English article systems.",
      "Teaching French instead, since it’s closer to Arabic."
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "feedback": " Knowing that Arabic lacks articles like 'a/an/the,' teachers can use CA to design contrastive lessons that directly address this gap and prevent fossilized errors."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does 'Complete Correspondence' indicate in CA?",
    "options": [
      "L1 and L2 are genetically unrelated.",
      "L1 and L2 structures are functionally and formally identical.",
      "Learners will still struggle despite surface similarities.",
      "No transfer occurs in either direction."
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "feedback": " 'Complete Correspondence'—the easiest case—means L1 and L2 share the same form and function (e.g., basic word order), leading to positive transfer and minimal difficulty."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which error is likely due to L1 interference for an Arabic speaker learning English?",
    "options": [
      "Saying 'goed' instead of 'went.'",
      "Using 'Have you seen him?' correctly.",
      "Saying 'He teacher' instead of 'He is a teacher.'",
      "Overusing the present perfect correctly."
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "feedback": " Omitting the verb 'is' and the article 'a' reflects Arabic sentence structure (which often omits copulas and lacks articles), making this a clear case of L1 interference."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is traditional CA considered 'predictive'?",
    "options": [
      "It forecasts learners’ final exam scores.",
      "It predicts future language policy changes.",
      "It uses L1-L2 comparison to anticipate learning difficulties before they occur.",
      "It estimates how long fluency will take for each student."
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "feedback": " Traditional CA is predictive because it assumes teachers can forecast where learners will struggle (e.g., with English articles) based solely on structural differences between L1 and L2—before actual teaching begins."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which statement reflects a balanced, modern view of Contrastive Analysis?",
    "options": [
      "CA explains every single L2 error and should replace all other SLA theories.",
      "CA is completely useless and has been disproven by neuroscience.",
      "CA is limited but remains a helpful tool for anticipating L1-based errors in specific teaching contexts.",
      "CA only works for Indo-European languages."
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "feedback": " While CA cannot explain all errors (e.g., developmental ones), it is still valued as a practical heuristic—especially in homogeneous classrooms—for curriculum design and error prevention."
  },

    "question": "What is the main assumption of Contrastive Analysis (CA)?",
    "options": [
      "L2 errors are primarily caused by cognitive overload.",

  },
  {
    "question": "According to Lado (1957), how can language teaching anticipate learner difficulties?",
    "options": [
      "By analyzing only the target language’s grammar.",

      "By ignoring the learner’s L1 to avoid interference.",
      "By focusing exclusively on communicative practice."
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "feedback": " Lado (1957) argued that comparing L1 and L2 (and their cultures) allows teachers to predict which structures will be difficult due to differences and which will be easy due to similarities—forming the predictive basis of CA."
  },

      "Using the word 'book' the same way in both languages."
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "feedback": " Arabic lacks indefinite articles like 'a/an,' so Arab learners often omit them in English—this is classic negative transfer explained by CA."
  },

    "question": "What does 'positive transfer' mean in Contrastive Analysis?",
    "options": [
      "The learner avoids using their L1 entirely.",
      "L1 and L2 structures are different, causing confusion.",
      "L1 and L2 structures are similar, facilitating learning.",
      "The learner overuses L2 rules in L1 contexts."
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "feedback": " Positive transfer occurs when similarities between L1 and L2 (e.g., both having a Simple Past tense) make learning easier for the student."

    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "feedback": " CA was criticized for overpredicting errors (predicting problems that didn’t occur) and underpredicting others (e.g., *goed*, which comes from L2 rule overgeneralization, not L1 interference). It also relied on outdated behaviorist assumptions."
  },

  {
    "question": "Contrastive Analysis assumes that the primary source of L2 errors is interference from the learner’s first language.",
    "options": ["True", "False"],
    "correct": 0,
    "feedback": "  As Lee (1968) stated, CA’s core assumption is that L1 interference is the main cause of L2 errors—greater differences between languages lead to more difficulty."
  },
  {
    "question": "Lado (1957) believed that comparing L1 and L2 could help predict which language structures would be easy or difficult for learners.",
    "options": ["True", "False"],
    "correct": 0,
    "feedback": "  Lado argued that by comparing the learner’s native language and culture with the target language and culture, teachers could predict learning difficulties and ease."
  },
  {
    "question": "Positive transfer occurs when differences between L1 and L2 cause learning difficulties.",
    "options": ["True", "False"],
    "correct": 1,
    "feedback": "  Positive transfer happens when L1 and L2 are similar, which facilitates learning (e.g., both having a Simple Past tense). Differences cause negative transfer."
  },
  {
    "question": "According to Stockwell et al. (1965), 'Split' is the least difficult type of linguistic contrast for learners.",
    "options": ["True", "False"],
    "correct": 1,
    "feedback": "  'Split'—where L1 has one form and L2 has two or more—is actually the MOST difficult type in Stockwell’s hierarchy of difficulty."
  },
  {
    "question": "Contrastive Analysis declined in the 1970s because it successfully predicted all learner errors with perfect accuracy.",
    "options": ["True", "False"],
    "correct": 1,
    "feedback": "  CA declined because it often overpredicted errors (forecasting problems that never occurred) and underpredicted others (like 'goed'), which stem from L2 internal overgeneralization, not L1 interference."
  },
  {
    "question": "The error 'goed' by an English learner can be explained by Contrastive Analysis as L1 interference.",
    "options": ["True", "False"],
    "correct": 1,
    "feedback": "  'Goed' results from overgeneralizing the English past tense -ed rule—a developmental error internal to L2 acquisition. CA cannot explain it because it’s not caused by the learner’s L1."
  },
  {
    "question": "Contrastive Analysis is still useful in homogeneous classrooms where all learners share the same native language.",
    "options": ["True", "False"],
    "correct": 0,
    "feedback": "  In such settings (e.g., teaching English to Arabic speakers), CA helps teachers anticipate common L1-based errors like article omission and tailor instruction accordingly."
  },
  {
    "question": "The traditional Contrastive Analysis approach requires collecting learner error data before making L1-L2 comparisons.",
    "options": ["True", "False"],
    "correct": 1,
    "feedback": "  Traditional CA is predictive—it makes comparisons first and forecasts difficulties without requiring actual learner data. Enhanced CA adds empirical validation afterward."
  },
  {
    "question": "Contrastive Analysis is rooted in behaviorist theories of learning.",
    "options": ["True", "False"],
    "correct": 0,
    "feedback": "  CA assumes language learning is habit formation, where L1 habits either help (positive transfer) or hinder (negative transfer) new L2 habits—consistent with Skinner’s behaviorism."
  },
  {
    "question": "In Stockwell’s hierarchy, 'Complete Correspondence' refers to when L1 and L2 structures are identical in form and function.",
    "options": ["True", "False"],
    "correct": 0,
    "feedback": "  'Complete Correspondence' is the easiest case—learners experience positive transfer with minimal difficulty because the structures match perfectly."
  },
  {
    "question": "An 'Absent Category' in CA means a grammatical feature exists in the L2 but not in the L1.",
    "options": ["True", "False"],
    "correct": 1,
    "feedback": "  An 'Absent Category' means the feature exists in the L1 but is missing in the L2. (A feature only in L2 is a 'New Category.')"
  },

    "question": "Robert Lado is the scholar most associated with developing Contrastive Analysis as a predictive tool in language teaching.",
    "options": ["True", "False"],
    "correct": 0,
    "feedback": "  Lado’s 1957 book 'Linguistics Across Cultures' established CA as a method to anticipate learning difficulties through systematic L1-L2 comparison."
  },
  {
    "question": "Enhanced Contrastive Analysis tests its predictions against actual learner performance data.",
    "options": ["True", "False"],
    "correct": 0,
    "feedback": "  Unlike traditional CA, the enhanced approach builds hypotheses from comparison but validates them empirically—making it more scientific and reliable."
  },
  {
    "question": "Saying 'He is teacher' instead of 'He is a teacher' by an Arabic speaker is an example of negative transfer.",
    "options": ["True", "False"],
    "correct": 0,
    "feedback": "  Arabic lacks indefinite articles like 'a/an,' so omitting them in English reflects L1 interference—this is classic negative transfer explained by CA."
  },
  {
    "question": "Contrastive Analysis can fully explain all types of second language errors, including those from overgeneralization.",
    "options": ["True", "False"],
    "correct": 1,
    "feedback": "  CA only explains errors caused by L1 interference. It cannot account for developmental errors (e.g., 'comed') that arise from learners overapplying L2 rules."
  },
  {
    "question": "The CA methodology requires using the same descriptive linguistic model for both L1 and L2.",
    "options": ["True", "False"],
    "correct": 0,
    "feedback": "  One of the five traditional steps is to ensure theoretical compatibility by analyzing both languages using the same grammatical framework (e.g., phonology, syntax)."
  },
  {
    "question": "In Stockwell’s hierarchy, 'Coalesced Forms' means L1 has multiple forms that are expressed by a single form in L2.",
    "options": ["True", "False"],
    "correct": 0,
    "feedback": "  For example, if L1 distinguishes formal/informal 'you' but L2 uses only 'you,' this coalescence creates moderate difficulty—ranked fourth in the hierarchy."
  },
  {
    "question": "Contrastive Analysis is only useful for teaching English to speakers of European languages.",
    "options": ["True", "False"],
    "correct": 1,
    "feedback": "  CA is applicable to any L1-L2 pair. It’s especially valuable for Arabic-English contrasts (e.g., articles, verb tense) in contexts like Algeria."
  },
  {
    "question": "Traditional Contrastive Analysis is considered a reactive approach that analyzes errors after they occur.",
    "options": ["True", "False"],
    "correct": 1,
    "feedback": "  Traditional CA is predictive—it aims to forecast difficulties before teaching begins. Error analysis (a later approach) is reactive, examining errors after they appear."
  },
  {
    "question": "Contrastive Analysis plays no role in modern language teaching materials or curriculum design.",
    "options": ["True", "False"],
    "correct": 1,
    "feedback": "  CA still informs textbook design, teacher training, and syllabus planning—especially in contexts with shared L1 backgrounds—by helping anticipate and address likely interference errors."
