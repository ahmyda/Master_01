  },
  {
    "question": "Why is effective teaching considered context-specific?",
    "options": [
      "Because all students are the same",
      "Because methods work identically everywhere",

  },
  {
    "question": "Which statement best reflects the evolving role of the teacher?",
    "options": [
      "Teachers should stick to one method forever",
      "Teachers are now multifaceted: facilitator, assessor, mentor, and planner",
