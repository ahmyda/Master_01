  {
    "question": "Define Applied Linguistics and explain how it differs from theoretical linguistics.",
    "options": [
      "Applied Linguistics studies idealized language systems while theoretical linguistics addresses real-world problems",
      "Applied Linguistics investigates real-world problems where language is central and seeks practical, interdisciplinary solutions, unlike theoretical linguistics which studies abstract rules",
      "Applied Linguistics is only concerned with language teaching while theoretical linguistics covers all language aspects",
      "There is no significant difference between the two fields"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "feedback": " Applied Linguistics, as defined by Brumfit (1977), investigates real-world problems where language is central and seeks practical, interdisciplinary solutions. Unlike theoretical linguistics—which studies idealized, abstract language rules—AL addresses messy, contextual issues (e.g., language teaching, policy, translation) and draws on psychology, sociology, and education (AAAL)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is 'Applied Linguistics' not the same as 'Linguistics Applied'?",
    "options": [
      "They are synonyms used interchangeably in academic literature",
      "'Linguistics Applied' is more modern and evidence-based than Applied Linguistics",
      "'Linguistics Applied' assumes direct application of linguistic rules, while Applied Linguistics involves contextual mediation and interdisciplinary adaptation",
      "Applied Linguistics only applies to education, while 'Linguistics Applied' applies to all domains"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "feedback": " 'Linguistics Applied' assumes language problems can be solved by directly applying linguistic rules, ignoring social and psychological context. In contrast, Applied Linguistics recognizes that real problems require mediation—interpreting linguistic insights through cultural, educational, and individual lenses (Widdowson)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which of the following is NOT a key characteristic of Applied Linguistics?",
    "options": [
      "Interdisciplinarity",

      "Exclusive reliance on formal syntactic theory",
      "Problem-solving orientation"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "feedback": " Applied Linguistics does not rely exclusively on formal syntactic theory. Instead, it integrates insights from psychology, sociology, education, law, and more (AAAL). Its strength lies in addressing complex, real-life issues beyond abstract grammar."
  },
  {
    "question": "According to Spolsky (2005), what is the focus of Applied Linguistics?",
    "options": [
      "Developing universal grammatical theories applicable to all languages",
      "Analyzing historical language change and etymology",
      "Resolving language-based problems that people encounter in the real world",
      "Creating artificial intelligence models for machine translation"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "feedback": " Spolsky (2005) defines Applied Linguistics as focusing on 'trying to resolve language-based problems that people encounter in the real world,' whether they are learners, teachers, lawyers, or policymakers."
  },
  {

    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "feedback": " Designing fair, valid, and culturally appropriate language assessments is a core area of Applied Linguistics (e.g., language testing). It addresses real-world needs while considering context, equity, and communicative competence."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does Applied Linguistics contribute to language policy in multilingual countries like Algeria?",
    "options": [
      "By enforcing a single national language based on historical precedent",
      "By providing evidence-based research to balance identity, equity, access, and practicality in language planning",
      "By prioritizing foreign languages over local ones for economic development",
      "By eliminating minority languages from public education"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "feedback": " Applied Linguistics informs decisions about which languages should be used in education, courts, and media. For example, it helps evaluate whether Tamazight, Arabic, or French should be mediums of instruction—balancing identity, equity, access, and practicality through evidence-based research."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is Applied Linguistics considered interdisciplinary?",
    "options": [
      "Because it only uses methods from theoretical linguistics",
      "Because real language problems involve multiple domains such as psychology, sociology, education, and law",
      "Because it rejects linguistic theory entirely",
      "Because it focuses solely on computational models of language"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "feedback": " As stated by the AAAL, Applied Linguistics integrates 'the humanities to the social and natural sciences.' Real language problems—like learning, legal interpretation, or speech disorders—require insights beyond grammar, drawing on psychology, sociology, education, law, and computer science."

      "Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA)",
      "Phonetics"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "feedback": " Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) examines how language in media, politics, or advertising reproduces power, ideology, and inequality. For instance, it might analyze how Algerian political speeches frame national identity through lexical and rhetorical choices."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a key limitation of theoretical linguistics in solving real-world problems?",
    "options": [
      "It focuses too much on social context",
      "It ignores the role of grammar in communication",
      "It studies idealized language systems and ignores context, identity, power, and emotion",
      "It overemphasizes classroom teaching methods"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "feedback": " Theoretical linguistics studies idealized language systems, ignoring real-world factors like cultural bias, power dynamics, or emotional context. As Spolsky notes, 'linguistics alone has very little to say about the real world.'"
  },
  {
    "question": "Which of the following is a valid example of Applied Linguistics in forensic contexts?",

  },
  {
    "question": "How has the scope of Applied Linguistics evolved since the 1960s?",
    "options": [
      "It has narrowed to focus only on second language acquisition",
      "It has expanded from language teaching to include forensic linguistics, CDA, computational linguistics, and clinical work",
      "It has abandoned interdisciplinary approaches in favor of pure linguistics",
      "It now excludes language policy and planning"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "feedback": " Initially focused almost exclusively on language teaching (especially post-WWII English instruction), Applied Linguistics has since expanded to include forensic linguistics, computational linguistics, CDA, lexicography, language planning, and clinical work—becoming a broad, socially engaged field."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the primary goal of language testing in Applied Linguistics?",
    "options": [
      "To assess knowledge of linguistic theory",
      "To rank students based on native-like pronunciation",
      "To design fair, reliable, and valid assessments aligned with real-world communication needs",

    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "feedback": " Language testing in Applied Linguistics ensures assessments (e.g., IELTS) are culturally unbiased, valid, and reflect real communicative competence—not just grammatical accuracy."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which scholar defined Applied Linguistics as 'the theoretical and empirical investigation of real-world problems in which language is a central issue'?",
    "options": [
      "Spolsky (2005)",
      "Chomsky (1965)",
      "Brumfit (1977)",
      "Widdowson (1990)"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "feedback": " Brumfit (1977) provided this foundational definition, emphasizing the empirical and problem-oriented nature of Applied Linguistics."
  },
  {
    "question": "What distinguishes Applied Linguistics as a 'multilateral' field?",
    "options": [
      "It only applies theories from one discipline",
      "It reformulates problems by integrating perspectives from multiple disciplines",
      "It avoids collaboration with other fields",
      "It prioritizes theoretical purity over practical outcomes"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "feedback": " Applied Linguistics is multilateral because it reformulates real-world problems by integrating insights from education, sociology, psychology, law, and more—rather than applying linguistic rules unilaterally."
  },
  {

  },
  {
    "question": "Why can’t theoretical linguistics alone address a student failing an English exam due to cultural bias?",
    "options": [
      "Because theoretical linguistics focuses on phonetics, not writing",
      "Because it lacks tools to analyze social, cultural, and contextual factors affecting test performance",
      "Because it opposes standardized testing",
      "Because it only studies spoken language"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "feedback": " Theoretical linguistics ignores context, identity, and power. A culturally biased test involves sociocultural factors that require Applied Linguistics—drawing on education, sociology, and assessment theory—to diagnose and remedy."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which of the following best describes the relationship between Applied Linguistics and theory?",
    "options": [
      "Applied Linguistics rejects all linguistic theory",
      "Applied Linguistics directly applies theory without modification",
      "Applied Linguistics mediates, adapts, and sometimes challenges theory based on real-world complexity",
      "Applied Linguistics only uses theories from the 19th century"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "feedback": " As Widdowson argues, Applied Linguistics doesn’t just 'apply' theory—it mediates and adapts it to human realities, often reformulating both the problem and the theoretical approach in the process."
  },
  {
    "question": "In which domain would Applied Linguistics help design communicative activities for Algerian EFL students?",
    "options": [
      "Lexicography",
      "Language Teaching",
      "Historical Linguistics",

  },
  {
    "question": "What is a central critique of the 'Linguistics Applied' approach?",
    "options": [
      "It is too focused on interdisciplinary collaboration",
      "It overemphasizes the role of context and emotion",
      "It assumes complex social problems can be solved by directly applying abstract linguistic rules",
      "It ignores the importance of grammar in language learning"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "feedback": " 'Linguistics Applied' is criticized for being rigid and unilateral—it assumes that inserting linguistic rules into real-world settings will solve problems, without accounting for cultural, psychological, or institutional complexity."
