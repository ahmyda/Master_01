            <p>All teachers want to know what kind of teachers they are, but they need to step back to reflect on their lessons through regular observation of their own teaching. This is a crucial component of <strong>ongoing professional development</strong>.</p>

            <div class="definition-title"><i class="fas fa-book"></i> Definition</div>
            <p><strong>"A systematic approach to the observation, evaluation and management of one's own behavior to achieve better understanding and control of one's behavior."</strong> - Armstrong and Firth (1984)</p>
            <p>Self-monitoring is a method of <strong>reflective teaching</strong>, which means thinking carefully about how you teach in order to improve. It serves as an approach to assessment that complements other forms of assessment.</p>

            <div class="process-title"><i class="fas fa-cogs"></i> The Self-Monitoring Process</div>
            <p>To improve as a teacher through self-monitoring, you need to:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Understand your own teaching</strong> - identify what you do well and what might need improvement</li>
                <li><strong>Collect real information</strong> - gather objective data about what happens in your classroom</li>
                <li><strong>Use systematic methods</strong> - ensure information is collected in an objective, structured way without personal bias</li>
                <li><strong>Analyze the information</strong> - make informed decisions about what to keep doing and what to change</li>

            <p><strong>Critical Thinking Prompt:</strong> "Critically evaluate the role of self-monitoring (or reflective teaching) in teacher professional development."

            <p>Self-monitoring has many applications in language teaching and is most effective when practiced regularly. <strong>Self-monitoring techniques give teachers far greater insight into their own teaching than traditional forms of teacher assessment</strong> and are simultaneously a simple but effective way of improving the management and understanding of their own teaching.</p>
