        <h2><i class="fas fa-comments"></i> Exam Preparation: Classroom Discourse & Interaction</h2>
        
        <h3><i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> 15 Likely Exam Questions & Model Answers</h3>

        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Q1: Why is teacher talk considered a “strategic tool” rather than just a means of instruction?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> According to Walsh (2011), effective teacher talk scaffolds learning by modeling language, managing interaction, and creating opportunities for learner output. It is strategic when it is purposeful—e.g., using simplified syntax for clarity or posing referential questions to stimulate discussion—rather than merely filling silence or asserting authority.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Q2: What is the difference between Teacher Talk Time (TTT) and Learner Talk Time (LTT), and why does balance matter?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> TTT refers to the proportion of classroom talk produced by the teacher; LTT by learners. While TTT is necessary for explanation and modeling, excessive TTT reduces opportunities for learners to practice language. The goal is not to eliminate TTT but to maximize <em>meaningful</em> LTT—episodes where learners negotiate meaning, express ideas, and use language communicatively (Nunan, 1987; Walsh, 2011).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Q3: Define Classroom Interactional Competence (CIC). Why is it important for teachers?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> Walsh (2011) defines CIC as “the ability to use interaction as a tool for mediating and assisting learning.” It includes awareness of turn-taking, questioning techniques, feedback types, and speech modification. Teachers with high CIC create inclusive, communicative classrooms where interaction supports—not hinders—language development.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Q4: Contrast display questions and referential questions. Which is more beneficial for L2 development and why?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> Display questions (e.g., “What’s the past tense of ‘go’?”) test known information; referential questions (e.g., “What surprised you most about the article?”) seek new information. Referential questions promote authentic communication, extended discourse, and fluency—key to second language acquisition—because they simulate real-world conversation where meaning is genuinely exchanged (Long, 1996).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Q5: Explain Kramsch’s (1998) distinction between pedagogic and natural discourse.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> Pedagogic discourse is teacher-led, structured, and focused on accuracy (e.g., drilling grammar rules). Natural discourse is collaborative, spontaneous, and focused on fluency (e.g., peer discussions about personal experiences). Kramsch argues that while pedagogic discourse is necessary for systematic learning, overuse creates an artificial environment that fails to develop real communicative competence.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Q6: How does learner talk contribute to second language acquisition beyond “practice”?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> Learner talk enables <em>output</em>, which Swain (1995) identifies as crucial for pushing learners to process language syntactically (not just receptively). It also facilitates <em>negotiation of meaning</em> (Long, 1996)—e.g., through clarification requests—which helps learners notice gaps in their knowledge and refine their interlanguage.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Q7: What is the IRF (Initiation-Response-Feedback) pattern, and what are its limitations?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> IRF is a dominant classroom discourse structure where the teacher initiates a question, a student responds, and the teacher gives feedback (Sinclair & Coulthard, 1975). While useful for checking understanding, overreliance on IRF limits learner agency, discourages extended talk, and reinforces monologic (teacher-centered) interaction rather than dialogic co-construction of knowledge.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Q8: How can teachers modify their speech to enhance comprehensibility without oversimplifying?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> Effective speech modification includes slowing rate, using clear pronunciation, repeating key phrases, and simplifying syntax—while avoiding infantilization. This “teacher talk” (not “foreigner talk”) maintains linguistic authenticity and supports input processing (Ellis, 2008), aligning with the Input Hypothesis (Krashen, 1985) while remaining pedagogically purposeful.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Q9: Why is turn-taking an important aspect of classroom interactional competence?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> Equitable turn-taking ensures all learners have opportunities to participate. Poor turn management (e.g., allowing dominant students to monopolize talk) excludes quieter learners and reduces overall LTT. Teachers with CIC use strategies like “think-pair-share” or random selection to distribute turns fairly and foster inclusive dialogue (Walsh, 2011).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Q10: How does the concept of “quality over quantity” apply to teacher talk?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> As Walsh (2011) notes, “Some teachers speak to speak—not to teach.” High-quality teacher talk is concise, context-appropriate, and learner-focused—e.g., giving clear task instructions, offering corrective feedback that promotes noticing, or modeling target language forms. In contrast, excessive, repetitive, or off-task talk adds cognitive load without pedagogical value.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Q11: In what ways can a teacher shift from pedagogic to natural discourse during a lesson?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> After introducing a grammar point via pedagogic discourse (e.g., explanation + controlled practice), the teacher can transition to natural discourse by assigning a communicative task—e.g., “Interview your partner about their travel experiences using the past perfect.” This creates an information gap and encourages spontaneous, meaningful use of the target structure (Kramsch, 1998).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Q12: How does Classroom Interactional Competence benefit learners, not just teachers?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> When teachers model and explicitly teach interactional features—such as how to ask for clarification (“Could you repeat that?”) or manage turn-taking (“I’d like to add something”)—learners develop their own interactional competence. This empowers them to participate effectively in both classroom and real-world conversations (Walsh, 2011).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Q13: What role does feedback play in classroom discourse, and what types are most effective?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> Feedback regulates learning. Recasts (implicit correction) and elicitation (prompting self-correction) are more effective than explicit error correction because they maintain fluency while drawing attention to form. Effective feedback is timely, specific, and integrated into ongoing interaction—not disruptive or judgmental (Lyster & Ranta, 1997).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Q14: Why is it problematic to view LTT merely as “filler” or “student chatting”?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> Dismissing LTT as off-task ignores its central role in language acquisition. Structured, task-based LTT—such as problem-solving in pairs or debating opinions—provides essential opportunities for hypothesis testing, peer scaffolding, and pragmatic development. The key is designing tasks that make LTT <em>purposeful</em> and aligned with learning objectives (Ellis, 2003).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Q15: How can a teacher assess their own CIC?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> Through reflective practice: recording lessons and analyzing interaction patterns (e.g., TTT/LTT ratio, question types, turn distribution), seeking peer feedback, or using Walsh’s (2011) CIC framework to evaluate how talk is used to mediate learning. Self-awareness of interactional habits is the first step toward more learner-centered discourse.</p>
