    <h3><i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> 15 Likely Exam Questions & Model Answers</h3>

        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Q1: Why isn’t teaching experience alone enough for professional development?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> Because experience without reflection leads to “routine repetition,” not growth. A teacher may have taught for 10 years but still rely on the same lecture-style lessons, unaware that students are disengaged. Self-monitoring breaks this cycle by prompting critical review—e.g., watching a video of class and noticing they only call on the front row—turning passive repetition into active improvement.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Q2: What is self-monitoring, according to Armstrong and Firth (1984)?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> It is “a systematic approach to the observation, evaluation and management of one's own behavior to achieve better understanding and control.” In teaching, this means deliberately tracking actions like questioning techniques or wait time—not just guessing how a lesson went, but collecting evidence to guide change.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Q3: How does self-monitoring help align a teacher’s perception with classroom reality?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> Teachers often believe they “encourage participation,” but a teaching log might reveal they ask 20 questions but only wait 2 seconds for answers—discouraging thoughtful responses. Video recording could show that 70% of interactions are with high achievers. This objective data closes the “reality gap” between intention and practice.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Q4: What are the four self-awareness dimensions, and how do they support teacher growth?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong>  
            – <em>Open Self</em>: Known to self and others (e.g., “I use group work, and students notice it”).  
            – <em>Secret Self</em>: Known only to teacher (e.g., “I’m nervous today, so I rushed the lesson”).  
            – <em>Blind Self</em>: Known to others, not to self (e.g., students see the teacher interrupts them often—but the teacher doesn’t realize it).  
            – <em>Hidden Self</em>: Unknown to all (e.g., untapped creativity in lesson design).  
            Self-monitoring helps uncover the Blind and Hidden Selves, enabling holistic development.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Q5: Why is systematic data collection better than relying on memory in self-monitoring?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> Memory is selective and biased—we recall successes more than failures. A teacher might “remember” a lively discussion, but an audio recording reveals 15 minutes of monologue followed by silence. Systematic tools (e.g., checklists, timestamps, student response logs) provide objective, detailed evidence for accurate reflection.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Q6: How can journaling serve as a self-monitoring tool?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> By prompting structured reflection after each lesson: “What worked? Why? What student seemed disengaged? What would I change?” Over time, patterns emerge—e.g., “Students are more active when I use realia” or “Grammar explanations over 10 minutes cause restlessness”—guiding future planning with evidence, not guesswork.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Q7: What role does video recording play in effective self-monitoring?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> It provides an unfiltered mirror of classroom dynamics. A teacher might think they “move around the room,” but video shows they stay at the board. They may believe they “correct errors gently,” but footage reveals frequent public corrections that silence shy learners. This visual evidence is powerful for confronting blind spots objectively.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Q8: How does self-monitoring go beyond initial teacher training?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> Initial training offers foundational knowledge, but real classrooms are unpredictable. Self-monitoring allows teachers to adapt theory to practice—e.g., a graduate trained in communicative methods discovers their large class needs blended techniques. Through reflection, they innovate: using WhatsApp for out-of-class speaking practice, then evaluating its impact via student feedback.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Q9: What is action research, and how does it relate to self-monitoring?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> Action research is a cyclical form of self-monitoring: (1) identify a problem (“Students don’t use new vocabulary”), (2) plan an intervention (“Introduce weekly word journals”), (3) act and observe, (4) reflect and adjust. It turns the classroom into a lab for continuous, evidence-based refinement of practice.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Q10: How might self-monitoring differ for a novice vs. an experienced teacher?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> Novices often focus on survival: “Did I finish the lesson?” or “Were students quiet?” Their self-monitoring might track basic routines (e.g., time management). Experienced teachers, however, reflect on deeper issues: “Am I fostering critical thinking?” or “How inclusive is my questioning?” Their monitoring targets pedagogical nuance, not just classroom control.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Q11: What challenges might teachers face when starting self-monitoring, and how can they overcome them?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> Common challenges include time constraints, discomfort with self-critique, or technical barriers (e.g., recording equipment). Solutions: start small (e.g., one 5-minute reflection per week), use simple tools (checklists on phone), and pair with a peer for support. Framing it as “growth,” not “failure,” reduces anxiety.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Q12: How does the “Blind Self” hinder teaching effectiveness?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> Unseen habits can undermine goals. For example, a teacher aims to be inclusive but unconsciously calls on boys 3x more than girls—a pattern only visible through student feedback or video review. Without uncovering the Blind Self, well-intentioned efforts may perpetuate inequity unknowingly.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Q13: Why is self-monitoring considered a form of reflective teaching?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> Because it transforms teaching from automatic routine into conscious inquiry. Instead of asking “What did I teach today?”, reflective teachers ask “How did students experience that lesson? What evidence shows learning occurred?” This shift—from delivery to impact—is the heart of reflective practice.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Q14: How can self-reporting tools like checklists improve teaching?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> They make implicit practices explicit. A checklist might include: “Used L1 only for clarification,” “Gave wait time after questions,” “Included at least 2 student-centered activities.” Over a week, patterns emerge—e.g., “I used L1 excessively on grammar days”—prompting targeted adjustments.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Q15: In what way is self-monitoring “simple but effective” for teacher development?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> It requires no external evaluator—just honesty, structure, and a willingness to learn. A teacher can start tonight: replay a mental snapshot of today’s lesson, note one strength and one gap, and plan one small change for tomorrow. Over time, these micro-reflections accumulate into significant professional transformation—making it accessible, sustainable, and deeply personal.</p>
