            <h2><i class="fas fa-comment-dots"></i>1. The Role of Teacher Talk</h2>

            <p>Teacher talk is not merely about issuing directions or filling classroom silence—it functions as a **scaffolded linguistic input** that shapes learning opportunities (Walsh, 2011). Effective teacher talk is purposeful, context-sensitive, and pedagogically strategic. It should:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Explain</strong> concepts clearly and accurately, using language that is comprehensible yet challenging (i.e., within learners’ <em>Zone of Proximal Development</em>; Vygotsky, 1978)</li>
                <li><strong>Organize</strong> the lesson flow by signaling transitions, setting expectations, and managing tasks</li>
                <li><strong>Model</strong> authentic language use—including pronunciation, grammar, discourse markers, and pragmatic norms—thus providing a rich input resource for learners (Long, 1996)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Crucially, the **quality and function** of teacher talk matter far more than its quantity. Excessive or redundant teacher talk can inhibit learner participation and limit opportunities for language production (Nunan, 1987).</p>

            <div class="quote">
                “Some teachers speak to speak—not to teach.” (Walsh, 2011, p. 12)
            </div>

            <p>In language classrooms—where English serves as both the <em>subject</em> of instruction and the <em>medium</em> of interaction—**maximizing meaningful learner talk** is essential. As Ellis (2008) notes, language acquisition thrives on opportunities for learners to *use* language communicatively, not just hear it.</p>

            <h2><i class="fas fa-comments"></i>2. Why Learner Communication Matters</h2>

            <p>Active learner communication is the engine of language development. When learners engage in authentic interaction, they move beyond passive reception to active construction of meaning (Swain, 1985). Specifically, learner talk supports:</p>

                    <dd>Through negotiation of meaning (e.g., clarification requests, confirmation checks), learners resolve ambiguities and refine comprehension (Long, 1996).</dd>

                    <dd>Interaction pushes learners from receptive skills (listening/reading) toward productive output (speaking/writing), which is critical for fluency and accuracy development (Swain, 1995).</dd>

            <h2><i class="fas fa-project-diagram"></i>3. Classroom Discourse: TTT vs. LTT</h2>

            <p><strong>Classroom discourse</strong> encompasses all verbal (and often nonverbal) interaction that occurs during a lesson. A key analytical distinction is between <strong>Teacher Talk Time (TTT)</strong> and <strong>Learner Talk Time (LTT)</strong> (Nunan, 1987).</p>

            <table>
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Acronym</th>
                        <th>Meaning</th>
                        <th>Pedagogical Purpose</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>TTT</td>
                        <td>Teacher Talk Time</td>
                        <td>Instructional modeling, task framing, feedback, and classroom management</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>LTT</td>
                        <td>Learner Talk Time</td>
                        <td>Opportunities for language use, meaning negotiation, peer collaboration, and fluency practice</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>

            <p>The goal is not to <em>minimize</em> TTT at all costs, but to ensure it is **strategic and facilitative**. As Walsh (2011) emphasizes, high-quality TTT that scaffolds learning is more valuable than low-quality LTT that lacks purpose. Ideal lessons create **extended, meaningful LTT episodes**—such as pair discussions, problem-solving tasks, or opinion-sharing—where learners co-construct knowledge.</p>

            <p>Kramsch (1998) conceptualizes classroom discourse along a continuum from <strong>pedagogic</strong> to <strong>natural</strong> discourse. This framework helps teachers reflect on the communicative authenticity of classroom interaction.</p>

                <div class="example-title"><i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i>Ideal Practice: A Balanced Approach</div>
                <p>Teachers might begin with pedagogic discourse to explicitly teach a grammar point (e.g., past perfect), then transition to natural discourse during a storytelling task where learners recount personal experiences using the target structure. This mirrors the “<em>focus on form within a focus on meaning</em>” approach (Long, 1991).</p>
            </div>

            <p>Kramsch (1998, p. 35) argues that while pedagogic discourse is necessary for systematic learning, overreliance on it can create an “artificial communicative environment” that fails to prepare learners for real-world interaction.</p>

            <p>Walsh (2011) introduces <strong>Classroom Interactional Competence (CIC)</strong> as a core professional skill for language teachers. CIC refers to:</p>

                “The ability to use interaction as a tool for mediating and assisting learning.” (Walsh, 2011, p. 2)
            </div>

            <p>CIC encompasses awareness of interactional patterns and the ability to adapt talk to support learning. Both teachers and learners can develop CIC through reflective practice and feedback.</p>

            <p>While display questions have a place in controlled practice, **referential questions** are more effective for developing communicative competence because they simulate authentic conversation (Brown, 2001). Skilled teachers strategically blend both, but aim to increase referential questioning as learners progress.</p>
