        <h2><i class="fas fa-hands-praying"></i> Introduction</h2>
        <p>Religion is one of the most powerful cultural systems shaping how individuals interpret the world and communicate within it. In intercultural communication, religion influences values, identity, ethics, and social behavior.</p>
        
        <div class="quote">
            "Culture and communication are inseparable, and religion functions as a deep structure within culture that guides meaning-making."
            <div class="quote-source">- Hall (1976); Samovar et al. (2017)</div>
        </div>
        
        <p>Understanding religious diversity is therefore essential for effective dialogue across cultures, particularly in globalized educational and professional environments.</p>

            <p>Religion operates as a foundational layer of culture that shapes how people perceive reality, communicate meanings, and interact with others from different backgrounds.</p>

        <h2><i class="fas fa-archway"></i> Religion as a Cultural Framework</h2>
        <p>Religion shapes perceptions of authority, morality, gender roles, time, and community. In many societies, religious teachings influence everyday communication styles.</p>

            <dt><i class="fas fa-handshake"></i> Communication Influence</dt>

    <!-- Religion and Identity Section -->
    <section class="section">
        <h2><i class="fas fa-id-card"></i> Religion and Identity</h2>
        <p>Religion is closely tied to personal and collective identity. For many people, religious affiliation provides a sense of belonging and meaning.</p>
        
        <div class="quote">
            "Identity is negotiated in communication, and religious identity can become especially salient in intercultural contexts."

        </div>
        
        <p>People may feel misunderstood or marginalized when their beliefs are ignored or misrepresented, which can lead to defensive or withdrawn communication behavior.</p>
        
        <div class="example-box">
            <div class="example-title"><i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> Communication Impact</div>
