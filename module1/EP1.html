        <h3><i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> Likely Exam Questions & Model Answers</h3>

        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Q: Define Applied Linguistics and explain how it differs from theoretical linguistics.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> Applied Linguistics investigates real-world problems where language is central (Brumfit, 1977) and seeks practical, interdisciplinary solutions. Unlike theoretical linguistics—which studies idealized, abstract language rules—AL addresses messy, contextual issues (e.g., language teaching, policy, translation) and draws on psychology, sociology, and education (AAAL). It doesn’t just “apply” theory; it mediates and adapts it to human realities (Widdowson).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Q: Why is “Applied Linguistics” not the same as “Linguistics Applied”?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> “Linguistics Applied” assumes language problems can be solved by directly applying linguistic rules, ignoring social and psychological context. “Applied Linguistics,” however, recognizes that real problems require mediation—interpreting linguistic insights through cultural, educational, and individual lenses. AL is multilateral and reformulates problems; “Linguistics Applied” is unilateral and rigid.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Q: Give three areas within the scope of Applied Linguistics with examples.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> (1) <em>Language Teaching</em>: Designing communicative activities for Algerian EFL students. (2) <em>Forensic Linguistics</em>: Analyzing threatening messages to identify authorship. (3) <em>Critical Discourse Analysis</em>: Examining how political speeches in Algeria construct national identity.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Q: Define Applied Linguistics using Brumfit (1977) and Spolsky (2005).</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> According to Brumfit (1977), Applied Linguistics is “the theoretical and empirical investigation of real-world problems in which language is a central issue.” Spolsky (2005) adds that it focuses on “trying to resolve language-based problems that people encounter in the real world,” whether they are learners, teachers, lawyers, or policymakers.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Q: What is the key difference between “Applied Linguistics” and “Linguistics Applied”?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> “Linguistics Applied” assumes language problems can be solved by directly applying linguistic theory. In contrast, Applied Linguistics involves <strong>mediation</strong>—interpreting linguistic insights through social, cultural, and psychological contexts. It is a multilateral, interdisciplinary process, not a unilateral application of rules.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Q: Give three areas within the scope of Applied Linguistics with examples.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> (1) <em>Language Teaching</em>: Designing communicative activities for Algerian EFL students. (2) <em>Forensic Linguistics</em>: Analyzing threatening messages to identify authorship. (3) <em>Critical Discourse Analysis</em>: Examining how political speeches in Algeria construct national identity.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Q: How does Applied Linguistics contribute to language policy in multilingual countries like Algeria?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> Applied Linguistics informs decisions about which languages should be used in education, courts, and media. For example, it helps evaluate whether Tamazight, Arabic, or French should be mediums of instruction—balancing identity, equity, access, and practicality through evidence-based research.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Q: Why is Applied Linguistics considered interdisciplinary?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> Because real language problems involve more than grammar or syntax. AL draws on psychology (learning processes), sociology (power and identity), education (teaching methods), law (forensic analysis), and computer science (AI/NLP)—as stated by the AAAL, it integrates “the humanities to the social and natural sciences.”</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Q: What role does Applied Linguistics play in clinical settings?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> Through <strong>clinical linguistics</strong>, AL helps diagnose and treat speech and communication disorders—such as aphasia after stroke, developmental dyslexia in children, or voice impairments—by applying linguistic knowledge to therapeutic interventions.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Q: Explain how language testing is an area of Applied Linguistics.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> Language testing involves designing fair, reliable assessments of proficiency (e.g., IELTS or national English exams). AL ensures tests are culturally unbiased, valid, and aligned with real-world communication needs—not just grammatical accuracy.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Q: How has the scope of Applied Linguistics evolved since the 1960s?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> Initially focused almost exclusively on language teaching (especially post-WWII English instruction), AL has since expanded to include forensic linguistics, computational linguistics, CDA, lexicography, language planning, and clinical work—becoming a broad, socially engaged field.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Q: What is the purpose of Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) in Applied Linguistics?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> CDA examines how language in media, politics, or advertising reproduces power, ideology, and inequality. For instance, it might analyze how news reports frame refugees using dehumanizing vocabulary—and offers tools to resist such manipulation.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Q: Why can’t theoretical linguistics alone solve real-world language problems?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> Theoretical linguistics studies idealized language systems, ignoring context. But real issues—like a student failing a test due to cultural bias or a miscommunication in court—involve identity, power, emotion, and access. As Spolsky notes, “linguistics alone has very little to say about the real world.”</p>
        </div>

        <h3><i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> Common Mistakes to Avoid</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Confusing AL with only language teaching (it’s much broader!)</li>
            <li>Saying AL “applies linguistics directly” (it mediates and adapts)</li>
            <li>Ignoring the interdisciplinary nature (AL ≠ just linguistics)</li>
            <li>Using vague examples (“helping people learn English”)—be specific!</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><i class="fas fa-brain"></i> Quick Revision Checklist</h3>

            <li>I can define AL using Cook, Brumfit, or AAAL (American Association for Applied Linguistics)</li>
            <li>I can contrast AL vs. Linguistics Applied</li>
            <li>I can list 5+ subfields with real examples</li>
            <li>I understand AL’s problem-solving, interdisciplinary mission</li>
            <li>I can discuss AL’s role in society (policy, tech, justice, education)</li>
        </ul>
