    <h2><i class="fas fa-graduation-cap"></i> Exam Preparation: Approaches in Applied Linguistics (Contrastive Analysis)</h2>
    
    <h3><i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> Likely Exam Questions & Model Answers</h3>

    <div class="example-box">
        <p><strong>Q1: What is Contrastive Analysis (CA), and what is its main assumption?</strong></p>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> Contrastive Analysis is a method that systematically compares a learner’s L1 and L2 to predict learning difficulties. Its core assumption (Lee, 1968) is that the **primary source of L2 errors is L1 interference**—greater differences between languages lead to more difficulties, while similarities ease learning.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="example-box">
        <p><strong>Q2: Explain Lado’s (1957) view on predicting language learning difficulties.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> Lado argued that by comparing the learner’s native language and culture with the target language and culture, we can predict which structures will cause difficulty (due to differences) and which won’t (due to similarities). This forms the basis of CA as a predictive tool in language teaching.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="example-box">
        <p><strong>Q3: What are positive and negative transfer? Give one example of each from Arab learners of English.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> <em>Positive transfer</em> occurs when L1 and L2 are similar (e.g., both Arabic and English have Simple Past tense → easier to learn). <em>Negative transfer</em> happens when they differ (e.g., Arabic lacks articles like “a/an,” so learners say *“He is teacher”* instead of *“He is a teacher”*).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="example-box">
        <p><strong>Q4: Describe Stockwell et al.’s (1965) hierarchy of difficulty from most to least problematic.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> From greatest to least difficulty: (1) <strong>Split</strong> (L1 has 1 form, L2 has 2+), (2) <strong>New Category</strong> (exists only in L2), (3) <strong>Absent Category</strong> (exists only in L1), (4) <strong>Coalesced Forms</strong> (L1 has many, L2 has one), (5) <strong>Complete Correspondence</strong> (same in both).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="example-box">
        <p><strong>Q5: Why did Contrastive Analysis decline in popularity in the 1970s?</strong></p>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> CA was criticized for **overpredicting** errors (predicting problems that never occurred) and **underpredicting** others (e.g., developmental errors like *goed* or *hurted*, which stem from overgeneralization—not L1 interference). It also relied too heavily on behaviorist theory, ignoring cognitive processes in learning.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="example-box">
        <p><strong>Q6: Give two examples of errors by Arab learners of English that CA can explain, and one it cannot.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> CA can explain: (1) omitting third-person -s (*he come*), (2) using Past Simple instead of Present Perfect (*Did you see him today?*). It **cannot** explain: *goed* or *comed*—these result from L2 internal rule overgeneralization, not Arabic interference.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="example-box">
        <p><strong>Q7: What are the practical applications of CA in modern language teaching?</strong></p>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> CA remains useful in **homogeneous classrooms** (e.g., teaching English to only Arabic speakers), **curriculum design**, **error prevention**, and **exploiting positive transfer**. It helps teachers anticipate common L1-based mistakes and tailor materials accordingly.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="example-box">
        <p><strong>Q8: What are the five traditional steps of CA methodology?</strong></p>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> (1) Select comparable linguistic tasks, (2) Ensure theoretical compatibility, (3) Use the same descriptive model for both languages, (4) Identify similarities and differences, (5) Develop teaching materials based on predicted difficulties.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="example-box">
        <p><strong>Q9: How does the enhanced CA approach differ from the traditional one?</strong></p>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> The enhanced approach adds **empirical validation**: it builds hypotheses based on L1-L2 comparison, **tests them against actual learner data**, and only develops materials if predictions are confirmed—making it more scientific and less speculative than the original predictive model.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="example-box">
        <p><strong>Q10: Why is CA considered behaviorist in foundation?</strong></p>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> CA assumes language learning is **habit formation**—where L1 habits either facilitate (positive transfer) or interfere (negative transfer) with new L2 habits. This aligns with Skinner’s behaviorism, which dominated SLA theory in the 1950s–60s before cognitive theories emerged.</p>
    </div>

    <h3><i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> Common Mistakes to Avoid</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Claiming CA explains ALL learner errors (it doesn’t account for developmental or overgeneralization errors)</li>
        <li>Confusing CA with Error Analysis (EA)—CA is **predictive**, EA is **descriptive**</li>
        <li>Stating CA is “useless today”—it’s limited but still valuable in specific contexts</li>
        <li>Ignoring the role of behaviorism in CA’s theoretical foundation</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><i class="fas fa-brain"></i> Quick Revision Checklist</h3>
    <ul class="checklist">
        <li>✓ I can define CA and list Lee’s four assumptions</li>
        <li>✓ I understand positive vs. negative transfer with examples</li>
        <li>✓ I can explain Stockwell’s hierarchy of difficulty</li>
        <li>✓ I know CA’s strengths, limitations, and modern relevance</li>
        <li>✓ I can distinguish CA from later approaches like Error Analysis</li>
    </ul>
