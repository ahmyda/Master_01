    <h2>Approaches to Academic Writing</h2>
    <p>Academic writing can be taught in different ways. Each approach focuses on a specific aspect of writing.</p>

    <div class="approach-grid">

        <!-- Text-Based Approach -->
        <div class="approach-card text-based" id="text-based">
            <h3>📚 Text-Based Approach</h3>
            <p>This approach focuses on the <span class="highlight">final written text</span>.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Writing is judged by accuracy and correctness</li>
                <li>Models and examples are very important</li>
                <li>Form and structure come first</li>

            </div>

            <p><em>Main steps:</em> Read model → copy structure → write → submit final version</p>

                <li>Writing is seen as a process</li>
                <li>Errors are part of learning</li>

        <h2>I. Building Blocks of Sentences</h2>
        <p>Understanding sentence structure begins with knowing the basic components:</p>
        
        <div class="table-container">
            <table>
                <thead>
                    <tr>

                        <th>Definition</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr id="sentence-def">
                        <td><strong>Sentence</strong></td>
                        <td>A complete thought with subject and verb, starting with capital letter and ending with punctuation.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr id="clause-def">
                        <td><strong>Clause</strong></td>
                        <td>Contains subject and verb, but may be only part of a sentence.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr id="phrase-def">
                        <td><strong>Phrase</strong></td>
                        <td>Group of words without finite verb, used as part of a sentence.</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
        </div>
        
        <div class="note-box">
            <p><strong>Key Distinction:</strong> A clause contains both a subject and a complete verb, while a phrase does not contain a finite verb.</p>

            <p>• Tolstoy wrote <em>War and Peace</em>, <em>Anna Karenina</em>, and <em>Hadji Murat</em>.</p>
            <p>• Leo Tolstoy, Maxim Gorky, and Anton Chekhov are Russian.</p>
            <p>• <em>Hadji Murat</em> was written during Tolstoy's life but published after his death.</p>

        <div class="example-box">
            <div class="example-title">Inserting Phrases:</div>
            <p>• Tolstoy wrote many novels: <em>War and Peace</em>, <em>Anna Karenina</em>, and <em>Hadji Murat</em>. (noun phrase)</p>

        <div class="note-box">
            <p><strong>Note that:</strong></p>
            <p>a. A simple sentence may contain a phrase, but not a (subordinate) clause.</p>
            <p>b. The difference between a clause and a phrase is that a clause necessarily contains both a subject and a (complete) verb, unlike a phrase.</p>
            <p>c. In a simple sentence, a phrase may be used as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>an additional extension to the main clause, e.g. the above appositive phrase "War and Peace," participle phrase "Reading War and Peace," and the prepositional phrases.</li>
                <li>A replacement of one of the main clause's elements: subject, verb, object, e.g. the above noun phrases, gerund phrase, adverb phrase, adjective phrase, and infinitive phrase.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>d. A main clause and a phrase can be combined with a comma (,), a colon (:), or no punctuation mark at all.</p>
