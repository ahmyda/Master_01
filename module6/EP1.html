        <h2><i class="fas fa-graduation-cap"></i> Exam Preparation: Fundamental Concepts in SLA</h2>
        
        <h3><i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> 15 Likely Exam Questions & Model Answers</h3>

        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Q1: What are the five core components of language?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> The five core components are: (1) <em>Phonology</em> (sound systems), (2) <em>Morphology</em> (word formation), (3) <em>Syntax</em> (sentence structure), (4) <em>Semantics</em> (meaning), and (5) <em>Pragmatics</em> (contextual use of language).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Q2: How is “second language” defined in SLA?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> A “second language” refers to any language learned after the first language (L1)—including third, fourth, or additional languages. It is typically acquired in naturalistic (e.g., immersion) or instructional (e.g., classroom) settings and differs from “foreign language” learning due to greater exposure and functional use.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Q3: What is meant by “phenomena language” in SLA?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> It refers to the observable features of learner language, such as error patterns, developmental sequences, and interlanguage structures that researchers analyze to understand how acquisition unfolds.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Q4: How does SLA distinguish “acquisition” from “learning”?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> “Acquisition” is the subconscious development of language ability through meaningful exposure and use (e.g., a child picking up grammar through conversation), whereas “learning” implies conscious study of rules—though SLA theory typically focuses on acquisition as the core process.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Q5: What is the purpose of “explanation” in SLA theory?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> Explanation provides theoretical accounts for *how* and *why* second language acquisition occurs—such as through Universal Grammar, input processing, or social interaction—moving beyond description to causal understanding.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Q6: What role do “rationale and critiques” play in SLA theory development?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> They involve evaluating the logical foundations of a theory and subjecting it to scholarly criticism (e.g., challenging UG’s assumptions), which helps refine or replace theories based on empirical and philosophical grounds.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Q7: How are SLA theories “constructed and assessed”?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> Theories are built from observations and hypotheses, then tested through empirical research (e.g., longitudinal studies, error analysis). Their validity is assessed based on explanatory power, predictive accuracy, and consistency with data.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Q8: What is Universal Grammar (UG) according to Chomsky?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> UG is the innate, biologically endowed language faculty that provides humans with universal linguistic principles and parameters, enabling rapid and uniform first language acquisition despite limited input.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Q9: What are the four main positions on UG access in SLA?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> (1) <em>Direct Access</em>: full UG availability; (2) <em>No Access</em>: UG is inactive after the critical period; (3) <em>Indirect Access</em>: UG operates only through the L1; (4) <em>Partial Access</em>: only some UG principles remain usable in L2 learning.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Q10: What is the focus of linguistic approaches to SLA?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> They focus on the structural properties of language and the role of innate knowledge (e.g., UG) in acquisition, often analyzing grammaticality judgments and syntactic development.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Q11: How do psychological approaches contribute to SLA?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> They examine cognitive mechanisms such as memory, attention, automaticity, and processing constraints that influence how learners perceive, store, and retrieve linguistic information.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Q12: What is central to sociocultural approaches in SLA?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> The belief that language develops through social interaction, cultural mediation, and collaborative dialogue—drawing on Vygotsky’s idea that learning occurs in the Zone of Proximal Development.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Q13: What do functional approaches emphasize in SLA?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> They emphasize language as a tool for communication, focusing on how learners use linguistic forms to fulfill needs like requesting, narrating, or persuading in real-world contexts.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Q14: How might UG explain cross-learner similarities in SLA?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> If all learners share access to the same innate linguistic constraints (UG), they are likely to follow similar developmental paths and make comparable errors—even in different L2s—because their grammars are shaped by universal principles.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Q15: Why is it important to compare SLA theories empirically?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> Because competing theories (e.g., UG vs. sociocultural) make different predictions. Empirical testing—through experiments, case studies, or corpus analysis—helps determine which account best explains observed acquisition patterns and informs effective teaching practices.</p>
