        <h2><i class="fas fa-graduation-cap"></i> Exam Preparation: Language Acquisition</h2>
        
        <h3><i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> 15 Likely Exam Questions & Model Answers</h3>

        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Q1: What is “acquisition” in SLA?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> Acquisition is the natural, unconscious internalization of a language system through meaningful interaction and exposure—not through explicit instruction. It is distinct from conscious “learning” and mirrors how children acquire their first language.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Q2: What are the four key components of language acquisition?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> (1) <em>Phonological processing</em> (sound systems), (2) <em>Morpho-syntactic development</em> (grammar), (3) <em>Semantic networks</em> (meaning), and (4) <em>Pragmatic competence</em> (contextual and social use of language).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Q3: What is Krashen’s (1985) key insight about acquisition?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> Krashen emphasized that linguistic development occurs implicitly through meaningful interaction—not through grammar drills or explicit teaching. Comprehensible input in engaging contexts drives acquisition.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Q4: How do nativist approaches explain language acquisition?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> They argue that humans possess innate linguistic capacities (e.g., Chomsky’s Universal Grammar) that guide acquisition. Children are biologically prepared to acquire language rapidly and uniformly, even from limited input.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Q5: What role does social interaction play in language development?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> According to social-interactionist theories (Bruner, Vygotsky), communicative context, scaffolding, and meaningful dialogue drive acquisition. Language develops through negotiation of meaning and culturally mediated input.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Q6: What is the current consensus on how language is acquired?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> A combination of innate predispositions, statistical learning (detecting patterns in input), and social motivation—integrating insights from nativist, cognitive, and interactionist perspectives.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Q7: How does behaviorist theory explain language learning?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> Skinner (1957) viewed language as habit formation through imitation, reinforcement, and operant conditioning—e.g., a child repeats “milk” after being rewarded, gradually shaping verbal behavior.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Q8: What is Chomsky’s Language Acquisition Device (LAD)?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> It is an innate mental faculty containing Universal Grammar—principles common to all human languages—that allows children to deduce grammatical rules from minimal input, explaining the creativity and speed of acquisition.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Q9: What happens in the pre-linguistic stage (0–12 months)?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> Infants progress from crying to cooing to babbling, develop categorical perception of speech sounds, and become attuned to the phonology of their native language(s).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Q10: Describe the one-word (holophrastic) stage.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> Occurring at 12–18 months, children use single words to express complete thoughts (e.g., “milk” = “I want milk”). Comprehension far exceeds production, and vocabulary reaches about 50 words.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Q11: What characterizes the two-word stage (18–24 months)?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> Children produce telegraphic speech (e.g., “Mommy go”), showing emergent syntax and rapid vocabulary growth—while omitting function words like articles or auxiliaries.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Q12: What is overgeneralization, and when does it occur?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> It’s the active application of grammatical rules to irregular forms (e.g., “goed” instead of “went”), typically in the multi-word stage (24–30 months), showing rule-governed, not imitative, learning.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Q13: How does language develop during the school-age years (6–12)?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> Children develop metalinguistic awareness (thinking about language), literacy enhances grammatical knowledge, and they acquire academic language needed for formal education.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Q14: Why does acquisition vs. learning matter for teaching?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> If acquisition occurs through meaningful use, teaching should prioritize communication, comprehensible input, and interaction—rather than isolated grammar drills or error correction.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Q15: Which theory best explains children’s creative language use?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> The nativist theory—because children produce novel, grammatical sentences they’ve never heard (e.g., “I goed to park”), suggesting internal rule generation, not imitation or habit formation.</p>
