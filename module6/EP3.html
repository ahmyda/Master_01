        <h2><i class="fas fa-graduation-cap"></i> Exam Preparation: Rationalism in Second Language Acquisition</h2>
        
        <h3><i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> 15 Likely Exam Questions & Model Answers</h3>

        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Q1: What is rationalism in the context of language acquisition?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> Rationalism is the philosophical view that reason—not sensory experience—is the primary source of knowledge. In SLA, it supports the idea that linguistic knowledge is partly innate. For example, Chomsky argues that children acquire language too rapidly and uniformly from limited input, suggesting an innate Universal Grammar (UG) guides the process.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Q2: How does Descartes’ “cogito ergo sum” illustrate rationalist thinking?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> It demonstrates knowledge derived through pure reason, not observation. Descartes uses logical deduction (“I am thinking, therefore I must exist”) to arrive at a foundational truth—showing that some knowledge is a priori, independent of experience. This underpins rationalist claims about innate linguistic structures.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Q3: What are the four core concepts of rationalism relevant to SLA?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> (1) <em>Innate ideas</em>—knowledge is hardwired; (2) <em>Prior knowledge</em>—some truths are known without experience; (3) <em>Deductive reasoning</em>—truths follow logically from axioms; (4) <em>Mind-world correspondence</em>—the mind’s rational structure mirrors reality. These justify positing UG as a biological endowment.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Q4: According to rationalism, how is first language acquisition best described?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> Not as “learning” but as <em>maturation</em>—a biological unfolding triggered by input. Children don’t “learn” syntax from scratch; they use input to set pre-existing parameters in Universal Grammar. This explains why acquisition is rapid, uniform, and occurs even with poor-quality input.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Q5: What role does linguistic input play in the rationalist model?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> Input acts as a <em>trigger</em>, not teaching material. It helps set grammatical parameters (e.g., head-first vs. head-last) and supplies lexical items, but the core syntactic principles are already present in UG. Thus, input is necessary but not sufficient for acquisition.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Q6: What is the “poverty of the stimulus” argument?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> It claims that the linguistic input children receive is too fragmentary, error-filled, and limited to account for the rich, rule-governed grammar they acquire. For instance, kids know ungrammatical structures like “*Is the boy who sleeping is tall?” are wrong—despite never hearing such corrections. This supports innate linguistic knowledge.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Q7: Do adult L2 learners have access to Universal Grammar? What do rationalists say?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> Rationalists are divided. Some (e.g., Flynn & Martohardjono, 1994) argue adults retain full or partial UG access, allowing parameter resetting. Others suggest maturational constraints limit UG use in L2, so adults rely more on general learning mechanisms—making L2 acquisition fundamentally different from L1.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Q8: How does rationalism explain the uniformity of L1 acquisition?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> Because all humans share the same biological endowment—Universal Grammar. Despite differences in environment or input quality, children follow similar developmental paths (e.g., stages like babbling → one-word → two-word), supporting the idea of an innate, species-specific language faculty.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Q9: What is the “initial state” and “steady state” in rationalist SLA theory?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> The <em>initial state</em> is the learner’s mind equipped with UG (principles + unset parameters). The <em>steady state</em> is the mature, target-like grammar achieved after input triggers parameter setting. Acquisition is the transition between these biologically constrained states.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Q10: How do empiricists challenge the rationalist view of language acquisition?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> Empiricists argue input is richer than claimed (Pullum & Scholz, 2002), and children use general cognitive skills—not innate grammar—to learn language. Corpus studies show child-directed speech contains systematic patterns, reducing the need to posit UG.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Q11: What evidence do usage-based theorists offer against rationalism?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> Tomasello (2003) shows children learn language item-by-item (e.g., “I want X”) before generalizing constructions. This bottom-up, piecemeal development contradicts the rationalist “parameter-setting” model, which assumes abstract rules are activated all at once.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Q12: How does cross-linguistic variation challenge Universal Grammar?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> If UG strictly limits possible grammars, languages should show less structural diversity. Yet linguistic typology reveals enormous variation (e.g., in word order, case marking, agreement). Critics argue this undermines the idea of strong innate constraints.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Q13: Why does individual variation in acquisition paths pose a problem for rationalism?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> Rationalism predicts uniform development since UG is fixed. But children differ significantly in pace, error types, and strategies—suggesting learning is influenced by environment, cognition, and input, not just biological maturation.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Q14: How might the Critical Period Hypothesis relate to rationalist SLA?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> It supports rationalism by suggesting UG access declines after puberty. Adults’ difficulty achieving native-like L2 competence—especially in syntax—may reflect lost biological access to innate linguistic mechanisms, aligning with Chomsky’s biolinguistic view.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Q15: Is rationalism compatible with classroom language teaching? Why or why not?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> Only partially. Rationalism emphasizes subconscious acquisition through exposure, not explicit instruction. Thus, methods focusing on drills or grammar rules (e.g., Audio-Lingual) are seen as ineffective for developing competence. Instead, rich, meaningful input (as in immersion) aligns better with UG-based views.</p>
