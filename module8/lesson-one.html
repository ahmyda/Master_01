                    <p>Needs analysis in ESP involves the systematic and comprehensive study of the language needs of the target learners, their goals and objectives, and the context in which they will use English. By conducting a needs analysis, ESP practitioners can design a course and develop materials that are tailored to the specific needs of the learners, ensuring that they acquire the language skills and competencies necessary to succeed in their professional or academic contexts.</p>
                    <p>This course provides an overview of needs analysis in ESP, including its definition, types, instruments, steps, and the importance of conducting ongoing needs assessment throughout the course. Additionally, a sample of needs analysis questionnaire is presented to illustrate the practical application of needs analysis in ESP course development.</p>

                    <p>Perhaps the basis of a sound approach to course design is to start with a profile of the needs of the learner, so as to fit what is taught to what is needed. ESP has an advantage over EGP, in that it brought into focus the concept of 'needs analysis'.</p>
                    <div class="quote">
                        <p>"In the context of ESP, needs analysis has become the dynamic impulse underlying course design, the justification for the S and the P, the driving force that has motivated teachers and course designers throughout the world ever since the magic acronym ESP came in."</p>

                    <p>Needs analysis in English language teaching has been defined in several ways:</p>
                    
                    <div class="definition-box">
                        <h4>Nunan (1988:75)</h4>
                        <p>Needs analysis refers to "a family of procedures for gathering information about learners and about communication tasks".</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="definition-box">
                        <h4>Brown (1995)</h4>
                        <p>Expanding on Nunan, Brown explained needs analysis as the analysis of both subjective and objective data to set up the objectives of the course that meet the requirements of the students and the institute. He later simplified the definition by adopting a more holistic perspective: "the systematic collection and analysis of all information necessary for defining a defensible curriculum" (Brown, 2009:269).</p>
                    </div>

                        <h4>Richterich and Trim (1980)</h4>
                        <p>Needs analysis comes to mean the whole cluster of techniques which lead to an understanding of the parameters of the learning situation: ego, learners, teachers, administrators, course-writers, producers, career-expectation and job satisfaction, social dynamics, learner-type and resource analysis, etc, are relevant factors in addition to the original predicted communication behaviour.</p>

                        <p>To sum up, needs analysis (NA) is generally regarded as a criterion of ESP, although ESP is by no means the only educational enterprise which makes use of it (Berwick, 1989; Brindley, 1989).</p>

                    <p>The term "needs analysis" first appeared in the 1920s but became central to ESP in the 1960s, as needs analysis became a significant part of ESP course development (West, 1994).</p>
                    
                    <p>Although Hutchinson and Waters (1987) highlighted that an awareness of needs distinguishes ESP from general English, their assumption was rejected by Seedhouse (1995), who believed that needs analysis theory and application can be applied in general English courses. Similarly, Long (2005) affirmed that any language course without a needs analysis does not provide detailed and selective goals or academic support to meet the learners' needs in the course time frame.</p>

                        <p>However, using a needs analysis is still more common in developing ESP courses. Needs analysis is seen to be related to other specific phases of ESP course development: course design, materials selection, pedagogical approaches, assessment, and evaluation.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <p>In addition, needs analysis is commonly considered as the initial phase in the linear process in course development, although Dudley-Evans and St. John (1998) viewed this as more cyclical. In other words, once overall needs for a course are established, decisions can be made in developing or redeveloping the course in terms of learning objectives, material selection or production, the teaching and learning approach, and evaluation (Jin 2014).</p>
                    
                    <p>Thus, many ESP practitioners have acknowledged that a needs analysis is fundamental to developing any language course successfully (Hutchinson & Waters, 1987; Kavaliauskiené & Užpaliené, 2003).</p>

                    <p>Needs analysis has been traditionally conducted during the initial stage of course development as the first step taken before a course begins (Hutchinson & Waters, 1987; Jin et al., 2014; Mazdayasna & Tahririan, 2008).</p>
                    
                    <p>However, Dudley-Evans and St. John's diagram of the stages in the ESP process indicates that needs analysis can be conducted at different stages of the course according to each situation. In many cases where the course is in place or an existing one is being revised, an on-going needs analysis may be carried out and justified (Dudley–Evans & St. John, 1998; Mohammadi & Mousavi, 2013).</p>
                    
                    <div class="highlight">
                        <p>An on-going needs analysis later in a course may lead to a successful revision of an ESP programme (Ahour & Mohseni, 2015; Prachanant, 2012).</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <p>The outcomes of an on-going needs analysis can then feed into the course re-alignment, which can be done by revising its objectives and modifying the teaching and materials (Dudley-Evans & St. John, 1998; Jocaité & Petruševičius, 2006; Kavaliauskienė & Užpalienė, 2003).</p>
                    
                    <p>In this sense, an on-going needs analysis can be conducted at various points in a course because the perceptions of learners, teachers and other stakeholders may change as they learn more about their expectations of the course and the students' immediate needs (Lowe, 2009; Robinson, 1991).</p>
                    
                    <div class="highlight">
                        <p>Therefore, it is essential to investigate potential changes in the perceptions of the stakeholders in different situations in order to assess whether the objectives of an ESP programme need to be revised and the changing needs of the students in the area.</p>

                    <p>According to Brown (1995) there are three steps in needs analysis:</p>
                    
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Making the basic decisions</strong> about the needs analysis</li>

                        <li><strong>Using this information</strong></li>
                    </ol>
                    
                    <h3>1. Making Basic Decisions</h3>
                    <p>Before any needs analysis study takes place, researchers must make certain decisions about the people involved in the needs analysis, and the types of information to be gathered.</p>
                    
                    <p>Four categories of people may be involved in a needs analysis:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Target group:</strong> People about whom information will be collected</li>
                        <li><strong>Audience:</strong> People who will apply the results of analysis</li>
                        <li><strong>Needs analysts:</strong> Those responsible for conducting the needs analysis</li>
                        <li><strong>Resource group:</strong> People who may serve as sources of information</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>2. Gathering Information</h3>
                    <p>There are various techniques that can be used for collecting data for a needs analysis:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Tests:</strong> Provide information about general ability levels and specific language problems</li>
                        <li><strong>Observations:</strong> Involve watching students and recording their behaviors</li>
                        <li><strong>Interviews:</strong> Gather personal information and views privately or in small groups</li>
                        <li><strong>Meetings:</strong> Useful to reach a consensus among people with different ideas</li>
                        <li><strong>Questionnaires:</strong> Efficient for gathering information on a large scale</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>3. Using Collected Data</h3>
