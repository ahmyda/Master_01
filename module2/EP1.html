    <h2><i class="fas fa-graduation-cap"></i> Exam Preparation: Sociolinguistics</h2>
    
    <h3><i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> 15 Likely Exam Questions & Model Answers</h3>

    <div class="example-box">
        <p><strong>Q1: Define sociolinguistics and explain why it is considered complex.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> Sociolinguistics studies the relationship between language and society. Its complexity arises from (1) the intricate structure of language itself, (2) the influence of social factors (class, gender, age, etc.), and (3) the need for methodological tools to analyze language use in real social contexts.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="example-box">
        <p><strong>Q2: What does Labov (2010) mean by “The community is prior to the individual”?</strong></p>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> This “central dogma” means that language is not invented by individuals but inherited from the social group. An individual’s speech reflects community norms, structures, and variations—language is a social product, not a personal one.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="example-box">
        <p><strong>Q3: Distinguish between micro-sociolinguistics and macro-sociolinguistics.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> <em>Micro-sociolinguistics</em> studies language in face-to-face interaction (e.g., how gender affects tag question use). <em>Macro-sociolinguistics</em> examines language at the societal level (e.g., why English dominates globally or how language policies affect education).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="example-box">
        <p><strong>Q4: Name three founding figures of sociolinguistics and their key contributions.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> (1) <em>William Labov</em>: developed variationist sociolinguistics; (2) <em>Dell Hymes</em>: proposed communicative competence; (3) <em>Charles Ferguson</em>: introduced the concept of diglossia.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="example-box">
        <p><strong>Q5: What is communicative competence, and who proposed it?</strong></p>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> Proposed by Dell Hymes, communicative competence is the ability to use language appropriately in social contexts—not just grammatically correctly, but also politely, clearly, and in line with cultural norms.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="example-box">
        <p><strong>Q6: Explain the concept of “diglossia” with an example.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> Diglossia is the coexistence of two distinct language varieties in a society, each with a fixed role. Example: In many Arabic-speaking countries, Classical Arabic is used in formal education/media, while local dialects (e.g., Darija) are used in daily conversation.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="example-box">
        <p><strong>Q7: How does social class influence language variation? Give an example from England.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> Social class affects pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammar. In England, upper-class speakers may pronounce “bath” with /ɑː/, while working-class speakers use /æ/—a marker of social identity known since Labov’s studies.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="example-box">
        <p><strong>Q8: What is a speech community? Provide a real-world example.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> A speech community is a group that shares linguistic norms and practices. Example: Medical professionals use terms like “stat,” “BP,” or “NPO,” which signal in-group membership and shared understanding.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="example-box">
        <p><strong>Q9: Why is language variation essential to language function?</strong></p>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> Variation allows speakers to express identity (e.g., regional pride), build social bonds (e.g., slang among teens), signal politeness or distance, and adapt to contexts—making communication dynamic and socially meaningful.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="example-box">
        <p><strong>Q10: How does gender affect language use according to sociolinguistic research?</strong></p>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> Women often use more standard forms and politeness strategies (e.g., tag questions like “nice weather, isn’t it?”), while men may use more vernacular forms—though this varies by culture and context (e.g., in some communities, men adopt prestige forms).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="example-box">
        <p><strong>Q11: What is Joshua Fishman known for in sociolinguistics?</strong></p>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> Fishman is known for his work on **language maintenance, shift, and planning**, especially in multilingual societies. He developed the **Graded Intergenerational Disruption Scale (GIDS)** to assess language endangerment.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="example-box">
        <p><strong>Q12: How does age contribute to language variation?</strong></p>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> Younger generations introduce new slang (“lit,” “rizz”), pronunciation shifts, and grammatical innovations, while older speakers retain traditional forms—creating generational linguistic differences that can signal social change.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="example-box">
        <p><strong>Q13: What is the difference between a dialect and a language in sociolinguistics?</strong></p>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> Sociolinguistically, the distinction is **political, not linguistic**. As the saying goes: “A language is a dialect with an army and a navy.” Mutual intelligibility alone doesn’t define it—social power and identity do.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="example-box">
        <p><strong>Q14: What role does ethnicity play in language variation? Give an example.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> Ethnic groups often develop distinct linguistic features. Example: African American Vernacular English (AAVE) includes grammatical structures like habitual “be” (“She be working”)—a systematic, rule-governed variety, not “broken English.”</p>
    </div>

    <div class="example-box">
        <p><strong>Q15: According to Whitney (1867), why is speech a social phenomenon?</strong></p>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> Whitney argued that “speech is not a personal possession, but a social” one—it belongs to the community, is learned through social interaction, and functions only within shared norms and conventions.</p>
    </div>

    <h3><i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> Common Mistakes to Avoid</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Confusing micro- and macro-sociolinguistics (one is interactional, the other societal)</li>
        <li>Saying “dialects are inferior” – all dialects are linguistically equal; judgments are social</li>
        <li>Assuming gender differences are universal – they vary across cultures</li>
        <li>Using “language” vs. “dialect” as a linguistic distinction – it’s sociopolitical</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><i class="fas fa-brain"></i> Quick Revision Checklist</h3>
    <ul class="checklist">
        <li>✓ I can define sociolinguistics and name 3+ founding figures</li>
        <li>✓ I distinguish micro- vs. macro-sociolinguistics with examples</li>
        <li>✓ I explain how age, gender, class, region, and ethnicity shape language</li>
        <li>✓ I understand key concepts: diglossia, speech community, variation</li>
        <li>✓ I recognize that language reflects—and constructs—social identity</li>
    </ul>
